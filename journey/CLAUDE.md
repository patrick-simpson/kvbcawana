# Journey Display — Project conventions for Claude

## Git workflow: push directly to `main` on every update

Every code change in this repo should be committed **and pushed to
`main`** as part of the same turn. There are no feature branches and no
pull request review step — the user has explicitly authorized direct
pushes to `main`. The deploy workflow at
`.github/workflows/deploy.yml` triggers on every push to `main`, so
each push automatically redeploys the live kiosk site.

Concretely, after editing any file:

1. `git add` the changed files.
2. `git commit` with a clear message.
3. `git push -u origin main` (no PR, no other branch).

**A deployed fix is NOT immediately live on the kiosk.** GitHub Pages
serves every asset with `Cache-Control: max-age=600`, and Chromium's
normal reload does not revalidate subresources that are still fresh —
so for up to ~10 minutes after a deploy, an F5 on the Pi reloads
`index.html` but keeps running the *previous* `schedule.js`/CSS from
disk cache (this survives a reboot too). This has already caused one
"the fix didn't work" false alarm during live testing. The kiosk now
reloads itself onto a new build within a few minutes on its own (see
"Self-updating kiosk" below), so this only bites when you are checking
inside those minutes: to verify a fix right now, wait 10 minutes and then
refresh, or hard-refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R) to bypass the cache immediately.
When a live symptom contradicts code you know is deployed, suspect this
cache before suspecting the code.

## Self-updating kiosk

Since 2026-09-16 the Pi picks up a deploy on its own, usually within a few
minutes, with no SSH and no keyboard. The ten-minute note above is now
only about *verifying a fix inside those minutes*: left alone, the kiosk
gets there by itself.

- **Build identity is stamped at deploy time**, because a site with no
  build step has nothing that knows its own commit.
  `scripts/stamp-build.mjs` runs in `deploy.yml` between the checkout and
  the Pages upload and rewrites the copy being uploaded: it writes
  `public/version.json` (`{ build, builtAt }`), puts the same SHA in
  `index.html`'s `<meta name="journey-build">`, and appends `?v=<sha>` to
  every `STAMPED_ASSETS` path: `src/schedule.js`, `src/style.css`,
  `brand/tokens.css`, `brand/fonts.css` and the wordmark
  `brand/logos/journey-white.svg`, every copy of each (the wordmark is on
  the page twice). A test stamps the real page and fails if any local
  `src`/`href` is left without `?v=`, so an asset added to the page has to
  be added to `STAMPED_ASSETS` too. It also rewrites the deployed
  `brand/fonts.css` so each font URL carries `?v=<first 12 hex of that
  font's sha256>` (see "Brand kit" below). The committed page keeps
  `content="dev"` and plain asset paths (a test pins that), the committed
  `brand/` stays byte-identical to the kit, and `version.json` is
  gitignored, so a checkout and the jsdom harness see the page exactly as
  before. The script is idempotent and throws if the meta is missing, if
  `brand/fonts.css` is missing or names no fonts, or if it names a font the
  deploy does not carry, which fails the deploy loudly rather than shipping
  a page that can never update itself or 404s its own type.
- **The `?v=` is not decoration.** Pages serves every asset with
  `max-age=600` and Chromium reuses a still-fresh subresource across a
  reload, so without it a reload would come back running the *previous*
  `schedule.js`. A changed query string is a different URL, so the new
  page pulls new assets immediately.
- **The poll**: every 3 minutes, and on the `online` event (rate limited
  to once a minute), `version.json?b=<now>` with `cache: 'no-store'`
  through `fetchWithTimeout` (5s), compared against the meta. A non-200
  is "no news" and the poller stays inert, which is what a local checkout
  and any unstamped copy see.
- **Never reload onto the old page.** `max-age=600` applies to
  `index.html` too, so `version.json` can report a new build minutes
  before the edge serving this kiosk stops handing back the old page.
  `index.html?b=<now>` is fetched no-store first and must actually carry
  the new SHA; if it does not, the next tick tries again. Without this,
  the reload looks exactly like "the deploy did not take", which is the
  false alarm this repo has already had once.
- **Never reload during something a room is watching.** `safeToReload()`
  requires no video attached, no teaching slideshow, no `previewMode`, no
  reader overlay, the Settings panel closed, no caption prompt, nothing
  focused in a text field, and not the splash waiting for someone to press
  Begin. In practice that means the Check-in Display is showing, or the
  Journey window has ended. A busy kiosk re-checks every 15 seconds and
  there is no forced deadline: an evening that never goes idle simply
  updates tomorrow. Nothing is persisted, and the reload is a plain
  `location.reload()` through a one-line `reloadPage()` indirection the
  tests stub.
- The embedded Check-in Display is a different origin and reloads itself
  through its own version poll; nothing here reaches into that iframe.

## GitHub Pages source must stay "GitHub Actions"

The repo's Pages setting (Settings → Pages → Build and deployment →
Source) must be **"GitHub Actions"**, never "Deploy from a branch".
With the branch source set, every push to `main` triggers GitHub's
built-in "pages build and deployment" workflow, which publishes the
repo *root* (no `index.html` there — only `public/` has one) and races
`deploy.yml`'s correct artifact; whichever finishes last wins, so the
live site flip-flops between two entirely different layouts.

That flip-flop is what made the 2026-08-22 kiosk outage so confusing to
diagnose, and it's worth understanding the interaction, because the two
layouts have **disjoint** valid URLs:

| Pages source | `/` | `/public/index.html` |
| --- | --- | --- |
| GitHub Actions (correct) | 200 | 404 |
| Deploy from a branch | 404 | 200 |

The Pi had been misconfigured to load `…/Journey-Display/public/index.html`
— a URL that is only valid under the *wrong* Pages source. So every time
the built-in branch build won the race, the kiosk came back to life and
the misconfiguration stayed hidden; every time `deploy.yml` won, the
kiosk 404'd. Fixing the Pages source made the kiosk's 404 permanent
rather than intermittent, which is why the Pi's URL had to be corrected
to the canonical root (`https://patrick-simpson.github.io/Journey-Display/`)
at the same time. **The lesson: a kiosk that recovers on its own is not
evidence the kiosk is configured right** — check the URL the browser is
actually on (`ps -eo args | grep -i '[c]hromi'`) before believing the
server is at fault.

`deploy.yml` has a best-effort step that tries to force the setting via
the REST API, but
the Actions `GITHUB_TOKEN` isn't allowed to change Pages settings
("Resource not accessible by integration"), so only a repo admin can
actually fix it in the UI. Symptom to recognize: a `dynamic/pages/
pages-build-deployment` run appearing alongside a push means the
setting has regressed.

## Tech stack snapshot

- Plain static HTML/CSS/JS — **deliberately no framework or build
  step**. This runs on a Raspberry Pi Zero from 2017 (single-core
  ARMv6, 512MB RAM), so keeping the page as light as possible for the
  Chromium kiosk browser matters more than developer convenience.
- Only `public/` is deployed to GitHub Pages (see
  `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`) — repo docs, workflow files, etc.
  never end up served on the live site. (The one README that is served is
  `public/brand/README.md`, because the kit mirror is the whole kit, byte
  for byte; see "Brand kit" below.)
- `public/index.html` is the only page. It mounts two full-viewport
  layers and toggles a `hidden` class between them rather than
  destroying/recreating either — the Awana Check-in Display iframe
  (`#checkin-view`) needs to stay connected in the background so its
  live check-in data doesn't have to reconnect when Journey isn't
  showing.
- The repo root also has small **Node tool scripts** run only by
  GitHub Actions, never on the Pi or in the browser: `fetch-current-
  lesson.mjs` (uses `jsdom`; see "Current lesson lookup" below) and
  `transcode-lesson-video.mjs` (shells out to `ffmpeg`, installed as a
  workflow step; see "Video transcoding" below). Neither makes the
  *site* a Node app: `public/` stays plain HTML/CSS/JS with no build
  step, same as ever. `node_modules/` is gitignored.
- `npm test` runs `node --test` over `test/`. `test/kiosk-dom.mjs` boots the
  real `public/index.html` + `schedule.js` in jsdom (media, object URLs and
  the Cache API stubbed; `caches` left undefined on purpose, which is the
  path a fresh kiosk takes), so page behavior can be tested by pressing the
  actual buttons rather than by calling internals. It boots as the real
  kiosk (a Pi Zero UA, one core, so `detectDeviceProfile()` reads low);
  pass its exported `DESKTOP` as the third argument for a page opened on a
  Mac. schedule.js is a classic
  script, so its top-level `function` declarations are reachable on `window`
  while its `let`/`const` state deliberately is not. Run
  `node --check public/src/schedule.js` alongside it. The one thing jsdom
  cannot see is layout, so `test/control-bar-layout.test.mjs` (and
  `test/corner-buttons.test.mjs`, see "Embedding note") opens the
  page in real Chromium through `playwright-core` (answering every request
  from `public/` itself: no server, no port, no network, schedule.js not
  run). It uses the same binary as the handout renderer
  (`PLAYWRIGHT_CHROMIUM`, else `/opt/pw-browsers/chromium`) and is skipped,
  and says so, on a machine without it.

## Brand kit (Awana 2026-27 catalog)

Owner decision 2026-09-27: every screen in the Awana family (lobby signage,
projector, this kiosk, the label printer) wears the 2026-27 catalog's design
language and full official branding. For Journey that means the catalog's
own identity: the wordmark whose O is a disc with a mountain peak cut out,
the club purple `#8A649D`, its deep shade `#56467F`, the deep ink `#403A77`
and the lavender tint `#DED5EA`, plus the house hot `#F15A28` for the one
thing to press. Three voices: **Paytone One** shouts (the lesson name, the
caption question, the settings title), **Londrina Solid** labels (kickers,
the corner tab, every button), **Figtree** is read (hints, settings text,
Read Prep, captions).

- **Paytone One replaced Galindo as the shout on 2026-09-29** (owner: Galindo
  "looks too much like SpongeBob"; picked from a side-by-side render). The
  kit's `tokens.css` names it in `--brand-font-display`, `style.css` reads it
  through `--jr-font-shout`, and `warmBrandFonts()` asks for
  `400 1em "Paytone One"`. Nothing in `public/` outside the mirror may name
  Galindo again (a test fails if it does); the posters' and the Check-in
  Display's faces are not this repo's business.
- **Paytone One ships WHOLE, never as a subset.** Its licence (SIL OFL 1.1)
  reserves the name "Paytone One", and a latin subset or a re-encode is a
  Modified Version that may not carry it. So `fonts/PaytoneOne-Regular.ttf`
  is upstream's file byte for byte and `fonts/paytone-one-full-400-normal.woff2`
  is the same font with every table untouched, compressed (README in the kit,
  "Paytone One and the OFL"). `test/brand-kit.test.mjs` pins the TTF's hash
  and that the WOFF2 expands to exactly the whole TTF. Do not swap in
  `@fontsource` files or trim the font to save bytes: the WOFF2 is 42.7 KB
  where Galindo's latin subset was 20 KB, a one-time fetch per font version
  (`warmBrandFonts()` runs it while the Check-in Display is up, and
  `stamp-build.mjs` versions the URL by the font's own hash). A browser that
  cannot decode the WOFF2 falls through to the TTF (114 KB) with the same
  metrics, which was checked by serving a garbage and a 404 WOFF2.
- **The shout is fitted, not just swapped.** Every shout size in `style.css`
  was drawn for Galindo. Paytone One's caps are shorter at one font-size
  (cap height .688 em against .725) and sit lower in a tight line box (ascent
  1.113 em against .983), so a bare swap made the lesson name 5% smaller,
  dropped it about .15 em away from the kicker it belongs under, and crowded
  the buttons below. Two tokens at the top of `style.css` undo that:
  `--jr-shout-fit: 1.05` multiplies every shout size (a test fails if a rule
  that sets the shout face leaves it out, and if the number stops matching
  the shipped font's cap height), and `--jr-shout-lift: -0.15em` is `top` on
  a relative box for the headlines stacked over other lines (the splash
  title, the caption question, the loading text): paint moves, layout and
  neighbours do not, and nothing is clipped. Measured against the Galindo
  screens at 640x480 and 1080p, the caps land within 3 px of where they were
  and the kicker-to-caps gap within 3 px; the widest name (RESURRECTION) is
  4% narrower than it was, so the doodle clearance the 7vw cap protects only
  grew. The settings title is fitted but not lifted: it is centred on its
  close button, and Paytone One centres on it better than Galindo did.
  `test/splash-fit.test.mjs` boots the page in Chromium (Pi user agent) and
  checks all 32 lesson names at 592x432, 640x480, 720p and 1080p: the shout
  face really loaded, one line, clear of the doodle cluster and the buttons,
  the kicker-to-caps air in range, and an accented capital (Paytone One
  reaches 1.16 em, past its own ascent) has no ancestor that clips it.
  Changing the shout again means re-measuring both numbers, not just the name.
- **Paytone One covers more than Galindo did** (Ș ș Ț ț, all Vietnamese, all
  of Latin Extended-A), but still no Cyrillic, Greek, Hebrew, Arabic,
  Devanagari, Thai or CJK: those fall through the stack to the system's
  rounded face, as before. Its digits are proportional unless
  `font-variant-numeric: tabular-nums` is set; nothing on this kiosk sets a
  number in the shout face.

- **`public/brand/` is a byte-identical mirror of the whole kit**, whose
  canonical copy is `Awana-Check-in-Display/shared/brand/` (read its
  README). Never edit it here. `node scripts/sync-brand-kit.mjs
  <signage-checkout>` re-copies it and rewrites
  `data/brand-kit-manifest.json` (a sha256 per file plus the signage commit
  that last touched the kit); `--check` compares without writing and exits 1
  on drift. `test/brand-kit.test.mjs` fails if the mirror and the manifest
  disagree in any file, so a hand edit, a half copy or a dropped file is
  caught here even though the canonical repo is not. Commit the mirror and
  the manifest together.
- **Self-hosted, never the network.** `index.html` links
  `brand/tokens.css` and `brand/fonts.css` ahead of `src/style.css`; no
  font, stylesheet or image comes from anywhere else (a test pins the only
  cross-origin URL on the page to the Check-in Display iframe). A browser
  fetches a web font only once text set in it is rendered, which here would
  first happen at the 6:30 splash on the evening connection, so
  `warmBrandFonts()` asks `document.fonts` for the three faces at startup,
  fire and forget; nothing awaits it and a failure only means the fallbacks.
  The TTFs and Londrina's 900 weight are in the mirror but never fetched.
- **Versioned like the code.** `scripts/stamp-build.mjs` puts `?v=<sha>` on
  both kit stylesheets and the wordmark, and `?v=<font's own hash>` on every
  URL inside the deployed `brand/fonts.css`, so a self-updated kiosk never
  pairs new `@font-face` rules with old font bytes, and a deploy that did
  not touch the fonts does not make the Pi fetch them again (see
  "Self-updating kiosk").
- **`style.css` reads the kit through `--jr-*` aliases** at the top of the
  sheet, each `var(--brand-…, <the kit's own value>)`, so the page still looks
  like itself if `tokens.css` failed to load; the test fails if a fallback
  drifts from `tokens.css`. `--u` is 1/100 of the largest 16:9 box's width
  (allowed to grow a quarter into spare height on the 640x480 safe-mode
  screen); every size built on it keeps a rem floor for phones.
- **The wrapper art is baked, not markup.** The bottom wave (the kit's
  Journey wave twice in one image, deep behind, purple in front), the corner
  tab and the two doodle clusters are SVG data URIs in `style.css`, drawn as
  backgrounds and pseudo-elements, so `index.html` gained only the wordmark
  `<img>`s and every id and class stayed put. Their path data is copied
  verbatim from `public/brand/shapes/` and `doodles/`, and a test pins each
  one there; only the fills are baked, because an SVG drawn as an image
  cannot inherit `currentColor`.
- **The Pi Zero paint budget is a test, not a habit.** `journey-splash-pulse`
  is the only `@keyframes`; no `filter` (prefixed or not), no
  `backdrop-filter`, no gradients;
  every `box-shadow`/`text-shadow` has zero blur (the kit's depth is a hard
  offset), with one exception, `#slide-template`'s soft text shadow, which
  copies Awana's deck. Measured in Chromium at 640x480 and 1080p: the idle
  splash and the loading overlay repaint nothing while their pulse runs (it
  runs on the compositor).
- **Awana's deck is not ours.** The teaching-slide images and the TEMPLATE
  slide's type (`#slide-template`, Calibri/Carlito over the deck's own
  texture) stay exactly as they were; only the controls around them wear
  the kit. The pillarbox stays black. `test/brand-kit.test.mjs` pins the
  deck's rules (`#slides-view`, `#slide-stage`, `#slide-image` and every
  `#slide-template*`) declaration for declaration, and fails if any other
  rule names those elements.

## About page (`public/about.html`)

A static showcase page for church leadership, one of three sibling pages
(Club Label Printer's home page, the Check-in Display's `about.html`, and
this). It is one plain HTML file with no script at all: the shared
`public/family.css` beside it (linked as `family.css?v=N`), and its own page
styles inline in a `<style>` block. There is no `about.css`.

- **The kiosk never loads it.** `index.html` does not link it, and it must
  never load `schedule.js` or `style.css`; nothing here should ever add
  weight to the Pi's page. `scripts/stamp-build.mjs` stamps `index.html`
  only, so `about.html` needs no build meta and is left untouched by the
  deploy (checked by running the stamp over a scratch copy of `public/`).
- **`family.css` is byte-identical across the three repos.** The canonical
  copy is `Print-TwoTimTwo-Labels/styles/family.css` and its spec is
  `Print-TwoTimTwo-Labels/docs/FAMILY-DESIGN.md`; change it there and copy
  the file byte-for-byte to all three, never edit this copy on its own.
  Anything page-specific goes in `about.html`'s inline `<style>` with the
  `jd-` prefix, built on the family tokens.
- **Bump the `?v=` token on BOTH about pages whenever `family.css` changes**
  (this one and the Check-in Display's `public/about.html`). Pages serves the
  stylesheet with `max-age=600`, and the Check-in Display's service worker
  serves same-origin stylesheets cache-first under its build's cache name,
  so a deploy that changes only the CSS under an unchanged URL may never
  reach a screen that already has the old copy. HTML is fetched fresh, so a
  new query string on the link is what carries the change.
- **The 6:30 start screen (Fig. 1 and the resume card) is drawn in the kit,
  with the kit's own faces.** The page links `brand/fonts.css` (the same
  self-hosted mirror the kiosk loads, full unmodified fonts) beside its
  Google link, which asks for the editorial faces only (Fraunces, Source Sans
  3, IBM Plex Mono): never Galindo (owner, 2026-09-29), never a Google or
  subset copy of a brand face. The recreation follows `public/src/style.css`'s
  splash: the deep ink field, the club purple corner tab and waves, Paytone
  One for the shout (with `1.05` fit and the `-.15em` lift), Londrina Solid
  for labels and buttons, Figtree for the hint. Its art is drawn fresh for the
  page (no kit file, no `<img>`), and "Journey" is set as plain text, not the
  wordmark: no Awana logo on this page. One deliberate departure, as on the
  Check-in Display's page: the Begin Video orange is `#CF4518`, not the kit's
  `#F15A28`, so its white label passes AA at mock size.
  `test/about-page.test.mjs` pins the palette to `brand/tokens.css`, the
  loaded faces, the departure and the no-image rule, and that nothing is
  fetched from another host but the ONE Google stylesheet for the editorial
  faces and its two preconnects (a v1 `css?family=Paytone+One` link, a mirror,
  a preload, an `@import`, a page-local `@font-face` or a `url()` to another
  host all fail it). The playback, slide-bar
  and Read Prep recreations below it are still the pre-kit black / red /
  system-ui drawings; redraw them the same way when they are next touched.
- **Licensing wording is strict** (see "Licensing boundary" above): the page
  says the kiosk plays curriculum the church already licenses through its
  own Awana Ministry Membership, used only within the church's own program
  (its kiosk and its leaders) and never shared or offered anywhere else, and
  that each lesson is prepared so even the little Pi plays it smoothly. It
  never says the kiosk plays "a copy", a "smaller copy", or anything
  "re-encoded" or "transcoded", and never implies the Pi plays full
  quality. It must never link to, name the URL or filename of, or advertise
  any lesson video, transcoded copy, Release asset, transcript, handout or
  slide image, and never say "re-host", "mirror", or "download" anywhere
  near the videos (the phrase is "saved ahead on the kiosk itself"). Screen
  mocks are CSS recreations with placeholder text: no video frames, no
  slide artwork, no curriculum text or imagery, no Awana logos.
- **The room is students.** Journey is the high-school ministry, so the page
  says "students", never "children", about the people watching the lesson.
- **Never link to the live kiosk.** Links out go to the two sibling pages
  (the labels home page and the Check-in Display's `about.html`) and the
  three GitHub repos only, never to this site's root or `index.html`, and
  never to the Check-in Display's root or `countdown.html`.
- Trademark: the "Not affiliated with or endorsed by Awana® Clubs
  International" line sits at the top, in the meta description and in the
  footer's full disclaimer.

## Daily schedule

`public/src/schedule.js` holds the switching logic:

- `JOURNEY_START_MINUTES` (18:30) / `JOURNEY_END_MINUTES` (19:15) are
  the schedule window in minutes-since-midnight, using the Pi's local
  system clock. Change these two constants to retime the switch.
- The Awana Check-in Display shows outside that window; the Journey
  placeholder shows inside it. This repeats every day — there's no
  date logic, only time-of-day.
- On load, the current phase is computed immediately (so a reboot
  mid-window comes up correct), then a ~15s poll only forces a view
  change when the phase actually flips (i.e. exactly at the two
  boundaries) — this is what lets the manual toggle button override
  the view in between without being fought by the poller.

## The Journey page itself

`#journey-view` plays the current week's "Journey: Advocates" lesson
video (a 32-week apologetics course, `https://clubs.awana.org/ym-course/advocates/`).
Each lesson is a direct `.mp4` file hosted on Awana's own CDN (not
Vimeo — confirmed by fetching the real page; each lesson ships both a
"Leader Video" and a "Student Video", and this repo always uses the
Student Video, since that's the one meant to play to the kids). If
`public/current-lesson.json` hasn't resolved a lesson yet, it falls
back to the plain placeholder (the Journey wordmark on the deep ink
field, nothing else) —
never a broken `<video>` — same "missing data renders nothing"
principle as the sibling Awana-Check-in-Display repo.

**Licensing boundary:** the church has an active Awana Ministry
Membership covering this curriculum for its own program. Everything
here is scoped to **internal, on-device playback only** — nothing here
should ever redistribute, advertise, or link to these video files for
anyone other than this kiosk. `public/lessons.json`'s `downloadUrl`s
point at Awana's own CDN and are the canonical source; this repo never
fetches them for any purpose beyond this kiosk's own playback/caching.

**Deliberate, informed exception — re-encoded copies:**
Awana doesn't offer a lower-resolution/lower-bitrate download for any
lesson (checked directly against the real page — only "Leader Video"
and "Student Video," both full quality), and the kiosk's Raspberry Pi
Zero cannot decode the originals (1080p H.264, ~90-220MB each) at a
usable frame rate. `scripts/transcode-lesson-video.mjs` (server-side,
in the nightly Action) re-encodes the current lesson down to something
the Pi Zero can actually play smoothly and writes it to
`public/current-lesson-video.mp4`, which GitHub Pages then serves —
technically a public URL, same as the rest of this site. The project
owner chose this trade-off explicitly, aware that it's a narrower
version of "never rehost" than the original wording: it's a re-encoded,
lower-quality copy, used solely for this kiosk's own playback, never
linked/advertised anywhere else — not a copy of the original files
being redistributed.

**Owner-approved extension (2026-08-22) — all lessons, on a Release:**
the same exception now covers Pi-playable 480p re-encodes of *every*
lesson video (32 Student + 31 Leader; week 27 has no Leader Video),
uploaded as assets on the `journey-videos-v2` GitHub Release in
kvbcawana (each under 25 MiB, by `scripts/pi-encode.mjs`; served from
awana.kvbchurch.org/journey/videos/, where `site/build.mjs` copies them on
every deploy, since 2026-10-03) by
`scripts/transcode-all-lessons.mjs` / the on-demand
`transcode-all-lessons.yml` workflow. The manual video-picker plays
these (originals were undecodable on the Pi Zero — reported broken from
the live kiosk), falling back to the original URL if an asset is
missing. A Release rather than `public/` keeps ~1.1GB out of the repo,
its history, and every Pages deploy. Same character as the nightly
exception: re-encoded, kiosk-playback-only, never linked elsewhere.
The owner explicitly approved this extension when asked directly on
2026-08-22. If you're touching this boundary in either direction,
that's a call for the project owner, not an assumption to make either
way.

### `public/lessons.json` — the fixed lesson map

Hand-maintained, not scraped nightly (the course itself doesn't change
week to week): `{ version, sourceUrl, lessons: [{ week, unit, lesson,
title, downloadUrl, leaderDownloadUrl, captions }, …] }`. `captions` is
`{ student: bool, leader: bool }` — a shipped manifest of which
transcripts exist in `public/transcripts/`, regenerated by
`scripts/update-captions-manifest.mjs` (re-run it after adding or
removing any VTT). It exists so `captionsAvailable()` in `schedule.js`
answers "does this video have captions?" from data the page already
has, instead of a network HEAD probe at the moment the operator presses
play — the probe survives only as a bounded (2.5s-timeout) last resort
for when lessons.json never loaded. `week` is a flat 1-32
count in course order (`unit`/`lesson` are the Advocates page's own
"Unit N, Lesson M" numbering — 8 units × 4 lessons). `downloadUrl` is
always the Student Video (the one the auto-scheduled 6:30 show plays);
`leaderDownloadUrl` is that lesson's Leader Video, used only by the
manual video-picker in Settings (see "Manual video preview" below) —
**`null` for week 27** ("Unit 7, Lesson 3: Suffering"), which really
has no Leader Video on Awana's own page, not a scraping gap. Built by
fetching and parsing the real Advocates page (all 32
`.m-lesson-resources-block` tiles, each with a "Unit N, Lesson M"
heading and a `.m-small-video-resource-tile` per video labeled "Student
Video" / "Leader Video" with its own download link) — rebuild it the
same way if Awana revises the course. Don't guess the Leader Video's
filename from the Student one: it's usually `…-leader.mp4` but three
lessons (weeks 17-19) use `…-leaders.mp4` (plural) instead — a real
inconsistency in Awana's own naming, confirmed against the live page,
not a typo to "fix" here.

### Current lesson lookup

`.github/workflows/update-lesson.yml` runs nightly (mirroring the
sibling repo's `update-calendar.yml` pattern): it calls
`scripts/fetch-current-lesson.mjs`, which resolves "what's the current
lesson" from the church's own TwoTimTwo calendar
(`https://kvbchurch.twotimtwo.com/calendar/index?current_only=Y`),
matches it against `public/lessons.json`, and writes
`public/current-lesson.json` — same-origin, so the kiosk never depends
on a third-party fetch succeeding at 6:30 PM. Only commits when the
resolved week actually changes (or weekly, as a staleness heartbeat).
If it can't confidently resolve a lesson, it exits non-zero and leaves
the last-good file alone — a bad parse must never overwrite a good
lesson with a wrong one. `scripts/transcode-lesson-video.mjs` then runs
as the next step in the same workflow — see "Video transcoding" below.

**`current-lesson.json` schema** (`version: 2`): `{ week, title,
sourceUrl, downloadUrl, transcodedAt, resolvedAt }`.
- `sourceUrl` is the original (large) lesson file's CORS-friendly CDN
  URL — see the CORS note further down. It's this script's own
  "did the lesson actually change" identity (`sameLesson()` compares
  `week`/`title`/`sourceUrl`, deliberately NOT `downloadUrl`).
- `downloadUrl` is what the kiosk actually fetches/caches/plays. It
  starts out equal to `sourceUrl` (so playback still works before
  transcoding catches up) and gets overwritten to the small, same-origin
  `current-lesson-video.mp4` once `transcode-lesson-video.mjs` succeeds.
- `transcodedAt` is null until that transcode succeeds for the current
  lesson. `fetch-current-lesson.mjs` resets both `downloadUrl` (back to
  `sourceUrl`) and `transcodedAt` (back to null) whenever the lesson
  genuinely changes, but **preserves** them across a heartbeat-only
  rewrite (same lesson, just re-confirmed) — otherwise every weekly
  heartbeat would discard a perfectly good transcoded video and make
  the kiosk fall back to the full-size original until the next transcode
  run, for no reason.

**Verified DOM contract** (confirmed against a real saved response —
see the comment at the top of `fetch-current-lesson.mjs`): this
`?current_only=Y` endpoint is a *different* page/template than the
general church calendar the sibling repo scrapes (`.dayline` divs) —
it's a per-club "current book track" table (`tr.book-track-mtg`), one
row per club, with a `Book Track` column ("Journey: Advocates") and a
`Section` column carrying TwoTimTwo's own counter label (e.g. "Faith
Foundations #7").

**"Faith Foundations" is the entrance gate, not the book.** Every club
runs through this generic onboarding sequence before starting whatever
book they're actually assigned — "Faith Foundations #7" means "7 weeks
into the entrance gate," **not** "week 7 of Advocates," even though it
shows up under the "Journey: Advocates" Book Track. While a club is
still there, the script defaults to **week 1** (the first Advocates
video) rather than leaving the display blank — an explicit default, by
request, not a match against the entrance-gate count.

**Once in the book, the Section text is "Unit N #M"** — verified
against this church's own full-year schedule (fetch
`?current_only=N`, one book-track table per scheduled meeting date for
the whole year, rather than just the current one). The Journey club's
schedule shows the last entrance-gate meeting as "Faith Foundations #7"
(2026-09-02), then the very next meeting (2026-09-09) as "Unit 1 #1",
continuing in lockstep with the Advocates page's own numbering through
"Unit 8 #4" (2027-05-19). So "Unit N #M" maps directly to
`lessons.json`'s `unit`/`lesson` fields — an earlier version of this
script guessed a flat 1-32 count instead, which happened to work for
Unit 1 by coincidence but would have been wrong from Unit 2 onward;
that guess has been replaced with this verified mapping.

The entrance-gate label check is deliberately tolerant of whitespace
(including a stray non-breaking space, which `String.trim()` alone
does not strip from the middle of a string) and case, normalizing
before comparison — the same tolerance `matchLesson()`'s `\s+` regex
already had, so a template variance doesn't turn into a permanent
nightly failure on one side but not the other.

### Video transcoding (`scripts/transcode-lesson-video.mjs`)

Runs as the step right after `fetch-current-lesson.mjs` in
`update-lesson.yml`. Verified against a real lesson file: Awana's
original is 1920x1080 H.264 Main profile, ~2.2Mbps video + 161kbps
audio, ~94MB for a ~5.5 minute lesson. Re-encoded to 854x480 H.264
**Baseline** profile (avoids CABAC entropy coding, which costs
meaningfully more CPU to decode than baseline's CAVLC — the actual
lever for a weak decoder, more than resolution alone), capped at
~700kbps video + 96kbps audio, **same original frame rate** (shrinking
resolution/bitrate/profile is what should let a weak decoder keep up;
dropping frame rate further wasn't part of the ask and would look
worse for no decode-cost benefit) — that lesson came out to ~17MB, a
~5.5x reduction, visually clean at normal TV viewing distance (spot-
checked by extracting and viewing real frames from both).

- Downloads `current-lesson.json`'s `sourceUrl` — server-side, so
  Node's `fetch()` doesn't care whether it's CORS-friendly (CORS is a
  browser-only concept); this is simpler than the browser-side
  constraint that made `sourceUrl` need to be CORS-friendly in the
  first place (see the CORS note below).
- Skips the work entirely if `current-lesson.json.transcodedAt` is
  already set for the current lesson **and** `public/current-lesson-
  video.mp4` still exists on disk — so a nightly run that finds nothing
  changed doesn't re-download/re-encode ~100-200MB for no reason.
- **Never fails the overall job.** Any failure (download, ffmpeg, disk)
  is caught and logged; `current-lesson.json`'s `downloadUrl` is simply
  left as whatever `fetch-current-lesson.mjs` wrote it as (`sourceUrl`,
  the original) — the kiosk still plays and caches that directly, just
  at full size/quality, rather than being left with no video at all.
- **Single reusable filename** (`public/current-lesson-video.mp4`),
  overwritten in place each time the lesson changes — not one file per
  lesson. Keeps at most one lesson's video present in the working tree
  at a time, matching the existing `current-lesson.json` pattern.
  Git still keeps every past version in *history* though, so the
  repo's `.git` size grows by roughly one lesson's transcoded size
  (~15-20MB) every time the lesson changes — around 500-600MB across a
  full 32-week run through the course. Not a problem at today's scale;
  if it ever becomes one, moving this asset to a GitHub Release (which
  doesn't bloat git history) is the natural next step. (The manual
  picker's batch-transcoded copies DO live on a Release now — see the
  owner-approved extension above — but this nightly file deliberately
  stays in `public/`: the kiosk pre-caches it with a browser `fetch()`,
  which needs a same-origin/CORS-friendly URL, and a Release download's
  redirect hop has the same missing-CORS-header problem the "why
  sourceUrl is a CDN URL" note below describes. Direct `<video>`
  playback, which is all the picker does, doesn't care.)

### Device profile: low power and full quality

The kiosk is the 2017 Pi Zero, but this same URL gets opened on a Mac, a
laptop and the odd phone, and the two want opposite things. So
`detectDeviceProfile(userAgent, hardwareConcurrency)` in `schedule.js`
(pure, wired to `navigator` in exactly one place) answers `'low'` or
`'full'`, and everything quality-related reads `effectiveProfile()`:

- **Low** when the UA says Linux on ARM (`armv6l`/`armv7l`/`aarch64`,
  which covers every Raspberry Pi), when it says Android/Mobile/iPhone/iPad (a small
  screen on cell data wants the small file), or when
  `navigator.hardwareConcurrency <= 2`. Everything else is full.
- **Per-device override** in Settings → "Playback quality": Auto / Full
  quality / Low power, stored under `journey.playback.quality` and read
  with the same try/catch shape as the caption prefs. Auto's label names
  what was detected ("Auto (detected: full quality)"), because a promise
  nobody can check is worth nothing on a wall-mounted screen. The answer
  is cached per page load and recomputed when the setting changes; a
  change applies at once (the iframe is swapped, the next pick reads the
  new profile), and a write that failed says so rather than claiming it
  saved, like the bullet editor.
- **Low is the old behavior, byte for byte.** Every rule below that
  predates this section is a low-profile rule, including the legacy
  unversioned cache key, which only the low profile may read.

What **full** changes, and nothing else does:

- The embedded Check-in Display loses `?lowPower=1` (see "Embedding
  note").
- The scheduled show plays Awana's ORIGINAL: a cache hit for it, else
  `current-lesson.json`'s `sourceUrl`, else `lessons.json`'s
  `downloadUrl` for that week (`originalVideoUrl()`).
  `scheduledVideoPlan()`'s "never play the undecodable original" guard and
  the `#journey-splash-quality` note it drives are low-profile only:
  nothing is degraded about playing the original, so there is no note.
- The picker plays the originals with the 480p Release asset as its
  one-shot error fallback, the exact inverse of the low profile
  (`previewSources()`). The same-week cached-copy shortcut still applies,
  pointing at the 1080p cache entry.
- `cacheLessonBundle()` pre-downloads the ORIGINAL Student Video from
  `sourceUrl` (CORS-friendly by design, see the CORS note below) instead
  of the transcode. That entry is **optional**: a cross-origin file served
  without CORS headers is not something this page can fix, so the failure
  costs the video and nothing else in the bundle, and store-before-evict
  still holds.
- **The two qualities can never be confused for one another.**
  `videoCacheKey(lesson, profile)` keys the original by its own URL plus
  `?q=1080`. That marker is a query parameter and not a `#1080` fragment
  on purpose: the Cache API ignores fragments when it matches, so a
  fragment would silently be the same key as the 480p copy.

Nothing about this rehosts anything: the originals are streamed (and
cached for this kiosk's own playback) straight from Awana's own CDN, the
same files `lessons.json` has always pointed at.

### Video playback and offline resilience (`public/src/schedule.js`)

No service worker — the browser's Cache API is used directly from
`schedule.js`, which is simpler and is all this page's caching actually
needs (a service worker was considered again for the 2026-09-01
offline-resilience work and deliberately rejected: everything below is
achievable with Cache API + blob URLs, and a mismanaged SW on a remote
kiosk can pin stale code indefinitely — strictly worse than the
10-minute Pages cache we already tiptoe around. Accepted residual risk:
a reboot during a total outage has no app shell to load).

- **No click or keypress may await the network before something visible
  changes** — this is a hard rule, learned live ("you click buttons and
  it doesn't respond" — reported 2026-09-01 from the kiosk on flaky
  WiFi). The two offenders were `requestPlayback()` (awaited a caption
  HEAD probe with no timeout before ANY DOM change, so Begin
  Video/Space/the picker looked dead while the network dawdled) and
  `openSettingsPanel()` (awaited lessons.json before unhiding the
  panel, so a hung fetch made the gear button read as broken forever).
  `requestPlayback()` now reveals the Journey layer + loading overlay
  synchronously and probes after; the settings panel opens instantly
  with a "Loading lesson list…" note that becomes a visible error state
  on failure. Anything the UI indirectly waits on goes through
  `fetchWithTimeout()`. Every control also got an instant `:active`
  press state in style.css (`transition: none` so it lands next paint).
  If you add a new interactive path, keep this property: acknowledge
  first, network later.
- **The whole current-week bundle is pre-downloaded, not just the
  video**: `cacheLessonBundle()` (on load, hourly, and on the browser's
  `online` event) stores the lesson video, BOTH caption transcripts, both
  roles' Read Prep transcripts, and the leader handout in
  `journey-videos-v1`. A 404 (week 27 has no leader
  VTT/handout) is "legitimately missing — skip", not a failure; the old
  bundle is evicted only after every piece of the new one stored
  (store-before-evict, extended from the old single-video invariant —
  on any real failure nothing is evicted and the next refresh retries).
  Playback then consumes the cache: caption tracks and the handout
  iframe get blob URLs when cached (revoked in `stopJourneyContent()` /
  `closeHandout()`), so captions and the current week's handout work
  offline. The *video* is the exception since 2026-09-16 (see "Playback
  streams first" below): the bundle is what plays when the network cannot
  serve it, not what plays by default. A same-week Student pick in the
  manual picker goes through the same `resolveVideoSrc()`, so it streams
  or plays the cached copy on the same rule. On the low profile that shortcut
  is gated on `currentLesson.transcodedAt`, so a not-yet-transcoded 1080p
  original never reaches the Pi's decoder that way; on the full profile
  the original is what it wanted anyway. Which video the bundle stores at
  all is the profile's choice (see "Device profile" above).
- **The cached video is keyed by `transcodedAt`, not URL alone**
  (`videoCacheKey()`, on the low profile; the full profile keys the
  original by `?q=1080` instead, see "Device profile"): the nightly
  transcode reuses one filename, so
  when the lesson changes, this week's and last week's bytes share a
  URL — and the kiosk essentially never witnesses the brief
  pre-transcode CloudFront-URL state whose URL change used to be the
  only thing that flushed the cache. Without the versioned key, a
  cached lesson would survive its own replacement and the kiosk would
  keep playing last week's video (latent from the day this cache
  shipped; would first have bitten at the first real lesson change).
  The transcripts/handout stay keyed by URL — they're per-week files,
  so a week change alone flushes them; only a mid-week caption
  correction can be ~a-week stale on an already-bundled kiosk, which is
  accepted.
- **lessons.json is cache-first**: fetched once at startup (5s timeout,
  good copy stored in `journey-assets-v1`), served from that cache with
  a quiet background revalidate afterward — the old
  `{cache:'no-store'}`-on-every-open is gone. The `captions` manifest
  (see above) is built from whichever copy loads; an old cached copy
  without the field just falls back to probing.
- **What still can't be pre-downloaded: the other 62 picker videos.**
  GitHub Release URLs 302-redirect without CORS headers on the redirect
  hop (verified live; documented below), so a browser fetch() can never
  store their bytes — only same-origin copies would make a "download
  all videos" feature possible, and rehosting is a project-owner call
  (see the licensing boundary above). The picker still streams those.
  **Asked and declined 2026-09-01**: the owner chose "current week is
  enough" over a same-origin mirror + download-all — don't re-raise it
  unless they bring it up.
- If the loading overlay stays up ~12s, its note switches to say the
  internet may be down and points at the ⇄ button (which never waits on
  the network) — a stalled fetch fires no error event, and an endless
  "Loading…" pulse is indistinguishable from progress.
- **The video no longer autoplays at 6:30.** Crossing into the
  scheduled window shows a branded "Large Group Time" splash
  (`#journey-splash`) instead — the catalog's Journey wordmark over
  ADVOCATES, the "Large Group Time" corner tab, and this week's lesson
  prominently named: a kicker (`Week 4 · Unit 1 · Lesson 4`) over the
  lesson's own name (`Logic`), both split out of `lessons.json`'s `title` by
  the pure `splashLessonText()` and filled in from `currentLesson` by
  `showJourneyContent()`. A title that is not "Unit N, Lesson M: Name" keeps
  the whole title as the headline and `Week N` alone as the kicker, so a
  change on Awana's side can cost the layout but never a word; a headline
  over 14 characters gets `.is-long`, the smaller size the old title used
  (every real name is one word of at most 12 letters, and a test walks all
  32). The headline is capped at `7vw` so RESURRECTION (week 18, the
  longest) clears the left doodle cluster on the Pi's 640x480 screen. The lesson video itself
  is still queued up in the background exactly as before (see the
  pre-fetch bullet right below) — only the on-screen *playback* waits.
  An operator starts it with **Space**, **→**, or the on-screen "Begin
  Video" button; all three are gated by `isAwaitingPlay()` (splash
  visible, Journey view showing, not `previewMode`) and funnel into
  `playCurrentLesson()`, which is the only thing that ever sets
  `journeyVideo.src` for the scheduled show. This also conveniently
  doubles as the audio-unlock gesture (see `audioUnlocked` below) —
  pressing Space/→/the button to begin is itself a genuine user
  action, so playback can start unmuted immediately rather than
  needing a separate tap. **The manual preview flow (Settings panel)
  is unchanged** — `startPreview()` still plays immediately, bypassing
  the splash entirely; the splash-and-wait behavior only applies to
  the scheduled 6:30 show.
- **An interrupted lesson can be resumed.** The scheduled show marks its
  position in `localStorage` (`journey.resume`, `{week, t, d, at}`) about
  every 5 seconds, and the splash then offers **"Resume at M:SS" + "Start
  over"** in place of "Begin Video" (never all three — Begin Video and Start
  over are the same action). Space/→ take whichever primary button is
  showing, so a reflexive tap resumes rather than restarting the room at
  0:00. The offer is deliberately narrow, because resuming into the *wrong*
  video is worse than restarting: the mark must carry the same `week` as the
  queued lesson, be at least 30s in, at least 10s from the end, and less
  than 4 hours old — anything else falls back to plain "Begin Video". The
  mark is written against the week actually attached to the `<video>`
  (`playingWeek`), not `currentLesson.week`, which the hourly refresh can
  swap mid-playback; manual previews never write one (`previewMode`), and
  the `ended` handler and `finishTeachingSlides()` clear it (both skipping
  previews). The seek itself is armed as `pendingSeek` and applied by ONE
  permanent `loadedmetadata` listener that re-checks `journeyRequestToken`,
  so a stale resolve can never seek a newer video. Reading the mark touches
  only `localStorage`, so the splash still renders with nothing awaited.
- On load, and hourly afterward, it fetches `current-lesson.json` and
  — regardless of what's currently on screen — pre-fetches that
  lesson's bundle (video + transcripts + handout, see
  `cacheLessonBundle()` above) into the `journey-videos-v1` cache
  bucket, skipping pieces already there. This runs well ahead of
  6:30 PM, so playback doesn't depend on the network being up at
  showtime (the church's Pi connection is known to be flaky in the
  evenings). A failed fetch of
  `current-lesson.json` (the flaky-network case this exists for) is
  treated as "no news" and never clears an already-loaded lesson —
  only a genuinely resolved lesson can replace `currentLesson`.
- **Why `sourceUrl` is a CDN URL, not the `clubs.awana.org` one
  `lessons.json` lists:** `clubs.awana.org` 302-redirects lesson
  downloads to a CloudFront-backed host, and that redirect response
  itself carries no `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header (confirmed
  against the live site). A browser `fetch()` in CORS mode — which the
  Cache API path needs, to read a response into a storable/playable
  `Blob` — fails outright on that redirect hop, even though the
  CloudFront target it points to *does* send
  `access-control-allow-origin: *`. Switching to `no-cors` mode is
  **not** a fix: an opaque response's body is null by spec (that's the
  whole point of the opacity), so `.blob()` on it always yields 0
  bytes, cached or not. The real fix has to happen server-side, where
  CORS doesn't apply — `fetch-current-lesson.mjs` resolves the redirect
  itself (a plain HEAD request) and records the already-CORS-enabled
  final URL as `sourceUrl`, falling back to the original
  `clubs.awana.org` URL if that resolution ever fails (still fine for
  direct `<video>` playback either way, which is never subject to CORS
  unless the `crossorigin` attribute is set — deliberately not set
  here). In steady state `downloadUrl` is the transcoded same-origin
  file, so this CORS distinction only actually matters for the (rare)
  case where transcoding hasn't succeeded yet and the browser has to
  fetch `sourceUrl` directly.
- The previous week's cached video is evicted only once the new one is
  safely stored, so a mid-download failure can't leave the cache empty.
- **Playback streams first; the cached copy is the safety net** (changed
  2026-09-16). The owner watched the live kiosk play a *picker* video,
  streamed from the Release over plain HTTP, perfectly smoothly, while the
  6:30 show — the same lesson, played from the Cache API as a blob URL —
  stuttered badly. Both files are the identical encode (854x480 Baseline
  3.1, 23.976 fps, same frame count), so the **blob-URL playback path on a
  single-core, 512MB device is the only variable**: no range requests, and
  the whole file materialised as one object before the decoder sees it. So
  `resolveVideoSrc()` now prefers the network URL whenever the network can
  answer — `navigator.onLine !== false` **and** one bounded `HEAD` through
  `fetchWithTimeout` (2.5s) coming back ok — and falls back to the blob when
  it can't. Both profiles, since a full-quality device streaming the
  original from Awana's CDN is exactly what the picker has always done.
  Acknowledge-first is untouched: the Journey layer and the loading overlay
  are on screen before `playCurrentLesson()` awaits any of this.
  `cacheLessonBundle()` is unchanged, store-before-evict included — the
  cache is still what makes a dead evening a non-event, it is just no
  longer the *first* choice on a working one.
- **One stall swap, and only one.** A streamed video whose `waiting` state
  persists for `STREAM_STALL_SWAP_MS` (8s) while the same bytes sit in the
  cache hot-swaps to them: the position is remembered, armed as
  `pendingSeek` and applied by the ONE permanent `loadedmetadata` listener
  with its token check, and playback resumes. At most once per playback
  (`streamSwapCandidate` is matched against the src the element actually
  carries, and spent by the swap), never within `END_STALL_TOLERANCE_S` of
  the end (the end-of-lesson handoff owns that stall), and never when
  there is no cached copy — which is every picker video, and any evening
  the bundle never landed. Captions, the handout and the slides still use
  blob URLs; they are small, and none of them is decoded in real time.
- The object URL, when one is made, is only ever revoked once its
  replacement is already in hand, and only released for good (along with
  detaching the `<video>` element) once the Journey window closes — a
  ~100-200MB decoded blob has no reason to stay resident for the other 23
  hours of the day on a 512MB Pi Zero.
- Video starts muted (autoplay policy) with a visible unmute button
  (a text label, not just an emoji glyph, since Raspberry Pi OS doesn't
  always ship a color-emoji font); finishing the video falls back to
  the Check-in Display immediately rather than waiting for 7:15.
- **Captions** (owner-requested 2026-08-23): every lesson video can show
  its transcript as WebVTT captions. Before playback the operator is
  asked once — **"Show captions?" Yes/No, with Y/N keys** (Space/Enter
  take the focused Yes default) — and the answer is persisted to
  `localStorage` under `journey.captions`. Because the prompt asks
  **once per device and then never again** (the owner's explicit
  choice), the **CC button in the control bar is the only route back to
  the setting** — keep it prominent, and keep it showing on/off state.
  Note the contrast with `audioUnlocked`, which deliberately is *not*
  persisted: a caption choice is a real operator preference with no
  browser-side counterpart, so persisting it is honest rather than a
  lie. Details worth not relearning:
  - `requestPlayback()` is the single gate every playback path goes
    through. It HEAD-probes the VTT first (memoized) and simply skips
    the question when a transcript is missing — week 27 has no Leader
    Video, and a future lesson revision could outpace the transcripts.
  - That gate **must reveal `#journey-view` before showing the prompt**.
    The prompt lives inside that layer, so asking while it's still
    `hidden` renders the question into a `display:none` ancestor: the
    operator picks a video, sees the Check-in Display, and playback
    waits forever on a question nobody can see. Caught by screenshot;
    don't regress it.
  - **Captions are painted by us, not by the browser.** The track runs in
    `mode = 'hidden'` (cues parsed, `cuechange` fires, nothing drawn
    natively) and `renderActiveCues()` writes them into
    `#caption-overlay`. Native `::cue` was tried first and abandoned for
    two measured reasons: its font-size had to be in `vh`, which
    collapses to ~11px on a phone held sideways (844x390), and native cue
    placement follows the *letterboxed* video box, so it drifted between
    form factors and landed captions on top of the control bar. A real
    element takes `clamp()`/`vmin`, and — unlike shadow-DOM cues — can be
    measured by the test suite.
  - Size is `clamp(18px, 4.5vmin, 56px)`: `vmin` tracks whichever screen
    dimension constrains the video frame, so one expression serves a TV
    read across a room (~49px at 1080p) and a phone in either
    orientation (18px floor). Verified at 1920x1080, 390x844, 844x390,
    and 1024x768.
  - `positionCaptions()` satisfies two different constraints at once: on
    a filled 16:9 screen captions only need to clear the control bar; on
    a letterboxed phone they instead sit just inside the video frame's
    lower edge, so they don't float in the black band. It reads the
    bar's live `offsetHeight`, so captions lift automatically when the
    bar wraps to more rows on a narrow screen.
  - **Cue length is a hard caption constraint.** Both caption sets are
    now built from real word timestamps into cues of <=84 chars (see
    "Leader transcripts" below for the 2026-09-06 leader redo). History
    worth keeping: the first Leader transcripts were whisper's own
    sentence segments, up to **202 characters** — fine to read, unusable
    as a caption (a wall of text on a TV, six wrapped lines on a phone) —
    and `scripts/resegment-vtt.py` split them at sentence/clause/word
    boundaries, apportioning duration by character count. That script is
    no longer part of the pipeline; it stays only as a record.
  - **Size and backdrop are per-device settings** (Settings → Captions):
    a size choice (Small 0.8 / Normal 1 / Large 1.3 / Extra large 1.6,
    `journey.captions.size`) and a solid dark backdrop for bright frames
    (`journey.captions.backdrop`), read with the same try/catch shape as
    the slide preferences. The size **multiplies** the existing
    `clamp(18px, 4.5vmin, 56px)` through a `--caption-scale` custom
    property rather than replacing it, so every option keeps the same
    responsive behaviour on every screen — note this scales the clamp's
    floor too, so "Small" really is ~14px on a phone, which is the point of
    choosing it. `applyCaptionDisplayPrefs()` re-runs `positionCaptions()`
    after any change, because the band's height feeds the letterbox and
    control-bar clearance maths. The **CC button remains the only on/off
    control** — these settings only govern how captions look.
  - The control bar itself needed a `max-width: 760px` media query: three
    non-shrinking buttons plus scrubber and time cannot fit one row on a
    phone, and the CC button was being **clipped off the screen edge** —
    captions became impossible to toggle on mobile. Note that media
    query must sit *after* the base control rules in the stylesheet; an
    earlier copy placed before them lost the cascade to
    `#video-scrubber { flex: 1 }` and the scrubber never got its own row.
- **Playback control bar** (`#video-controls`): **Back 15s**, pause/play,
  **Skip 15s**, the unmute button, a finger-sized scrubber, and an
  elapsed/total time readout, along the bottom whenever a video is active.
  The two 15-second jumps (also **`,`** / **`.`**, with **`[`** / **`]`** as
  aliases) exist because dragging a finger-sized scrubber on a projected
  screen to replay one sentence always overshoots; they seek an
  already-attached source, so nothing is fetched and nothing is awaited.
  They clamp to `duration - 0.25` so a skip can never trip the `ended`
  handoff by accident — **→ stays the deliberate way on to the slides, and
  ← is left alone** because it means "previous slide" once those are up.
  Key repeats are ignored: a held key would queue seeks faster than the
  Pi's decoder can serve them. Five pills no longer fit one row alongside a
  usable scrubber below ~1100px, so **the bar's wrap media query is
  `max-width: 1100px`**, not the 760px it was with three — below that the
  scrubber was being squeezed to zero width (`flex: 1` with `min-width: 0`
  shrinks silently rather than overflowing; measured at 844x390). In that
  block the scrubber's basis is `calc(100% - 8rem)` so it and the time
  readout fill the first row exactly and the pills wrap together beneath
  them, rather than two or three tagging along on the scrubber's row. The
  readout's box is the rest of that row, `calc(8rem - 6px)` (the column gap)
  and right-aligned, not the width of its text: with the kit's narrower
  Londrina pills a short `0:00`, which is what it says through the whole
  loading wait, left room for Back 15s on the scrubber's row, and the pill
  dropped back under the operator's finger when the duration arrived.
  `test/control-bar-layout.test.mjs` measures it at the Pi's sizes. It fades out with the
  same `cursor-hidden` idle mechanism as the mouse cursor (touches
  count as activity too — phones have no mousemove) and is pinned
  visible while paused (`.force-visible`), since a frozen frame with no
  visible controls reads as a crash. Tapping/clicking the video itself
  toggles pause, and Space does too during playback (guarded so it
  never fires while the settings panel is open or a button has focus —
  and Space's original job, starting the splash's queued lesson, takes
  precedence). The bar's right inset reserves room for the view-toggle
  button in the corner.
- **The splash and loading overlays are viewport-responsive**
  (`clamp()` type sizes and a clamp()-sized wordmark image, each with a
  rem floor) — the page is occasionally
  opened on a phone, where the original fixed TV sizes overflowed; the
  Space/→ keyboard hint is hidden on touch-only devices. A
  failed/stalled video load falls back to the placeholder too, rather
  than a silent black frame indistinguishable from a dead display.
  `video.loop` is explicitly set `false` (it was never looping by
  accident, but this makes the intent explicit rather than relying on
  the element's default).
- **Autoplay-with-sound after the first click:** browsers only allow
  *unmuted* autoplay once a genuine user gesture has occurred on the
  page. This page's only clickable elements are its two corner buttons,
  the splash's "Begin Video" button, and the Space/→ keys that start
  the scheduled lesson (a click inside the Check-in Display iframe is a
  different origin and never bubbles up to this document); any of them
  sets an in-memory `audioUnlocked` flag before `playCurrentLesson()`
  reads it, so the scheduled lesson now starts unmuted from its very
  first play — the splash's whole reason for existing is that playback
  never begins without one of these gestures having just happened.
  Deliberately **not** persisted to `localStorage` — the browser's own
  gesture-based permission is itself scoped to the page's lifetime (it
  doesn't survive a reload/reboot either), so persisting "still
  unlocked" past that point would just be wrong. The one path that can
  still start muted is a manual preview (Settings panel) opened before
  any gesture on the page at all — rare, since opening Settings is
  itself a click.
- **`lastPhase` invariant — do not break this again:** `lastPhase`
  tracks only the *scheduled* phase (for detecting a genuine 18:30/
  19:15 boundary crossing); the manual toggle button and the video's
  `ended` handler both call `setView()` directly to change what's on
  screen *without* touching `lastPhase`. That's what lets either of
  them hold a view that disagrees with `scheduledPhase()` (checkin
  shown early, or shown again after the lesson finished early) without
  the next 15s poll tick fighting them. An earlier version of the
  `ended` handler set `lastPhase = 'checkin'` directly, which made the
  *very next* poll tick see a manufactured "flip" back to `'journey'`
  and restart the lesson from frame zero — confirmed live before the
  fix. If you touch the poller or either handler, re-verify this
  property doesn't regress.
- A **loading overlay** (`#journey-loading`) covers the gap between
  asking a video to play and frames actually rendering — shown by
  `playCurrentLesson()`/`startPreview()`, re-shown by the video's
  `waiting` event on mid-play buffering stalls, hidden by `playing` and
  on every teardown/error path. It exists mostly for manual previews,
  which stream Awana's full-size originals and can take long enough to
  start that the screen otherwise reads as dead. Cheap opacity pulse
  only, same animation budget as the splash.
- The **mouse cursor auto-hides after 5s idle** and reappears on any
  mouse movement (`cursor-hidden` class on `<html>`, toggled in
  `schedule.js`). An earlier version set `cursor: none`
  unconditionally, which made the Journey view impossible to navigate
  with a mouse — reported broken from the live kiosk, don't regress it.
  Note the parent page never sees mousemove while the pointer is over
  the Check-in Display iframe (cross-origin) — the embedded app governs
  its own cursor there, and that's fine.
- The **Settings panel is sized as a 10-foot UI** (rows ~1.5rem in a
  ~1100px card) — it renders on a TV read from across a room, not a
  desktop monitor; "too small to read" was likewise reported from the
  live kiosk.
- A screen [Wake Lock](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Screen_Wake_Lock_API)
  is requested on load and re-acquired on `visibilitychange`, since
  Raspberry Pi OS's default screen-blanking would otherwise leave the
  kiosk asleep long before 6:30 PM with no local activity to prevent
  it. Not fatal if unsupported — disabling blanking at the OS level
  (see `PI_SETUP.md`) is the belt-and-braces fallback either way.

### Leader transcripts and handouts (owner-requested 2026-08-22)

Derived text content from the Leader Videos, same licensing character
as the re-encoded videos (internal ministry use for this church's own
leaders, never linked/advertised elsewhere; owner requested this
directly):

- **`public/transcripts/week-NN-leader.vtt`** — WebVTT transcript of
  each Leader Video (31 files; week 27 has none to transcribe). First
  generated with faster-whisper "small" (sentence segments); **redone
  2026-09-06 at large-v3** through the same pipeline as the Student
  captions — `transcribe-student-captions.py leader` (word timestamps,
  domain-vocabulary prompt, hallucination-hardened flags), a per-week
  review pass writing `leader-corrections/week-NN.json` (mostly the
  boundary-repeat words that `condition_on_previous_text=False`
  produces, plus capitalisation and a handful of real mishearings), the
  physics validator, an audio re-decode of every flagged cue, then
  `build-student-captions.py leader`. Same-origin, so they work as
  `<track>` captions without CORS issues. Regenerate only if Awana
  revises a video. Measured against the old pass: ~2.5% of words sat in
  a changed hunk; most hunks were filler, but the redo fixed real
  meaning errors ("except Christ" → "accept Christ", "relative to this
  day" → "relativistic", "the fairy" → "the Tooth Fairy", dropped
  clauses like "The doctor told me") and cut cue counts by roughly a
  third because cues now follow speech instead of split sentences.
  **Re-transcribing renumbers every cue**, and `data/leader-transcript-
  prose.json` addresses cues by number — run
  `scripts/remap-transcript-prose-cues.py <dir-of-old-vtts>` before the
  prose validator, which maps each paragraph boundary by time onto the
  new numbering (keep a copy of the old VTTs for exactly this).
  Two names both whisper passes garbled and the review pass now knows:
  the Awana Youth Ministries site is **AwanaYM.org**, and the author of
  *Questioning the Bible* is **Jonathan Morrow**.
- **Captions must be verified against AUDIO, not by reading.** Whisper
  hallucinates, and this bit us: run with
  `condition_on_previous_text=True` (the library default) it repeats and
  invents fluent text that no amount of proofreading can distinguish
  from a real sentence. Week 1 cue 53 read "Apology is not just about
  being an apologist." — a perfectly sensible line that **does not exist
  in the audio at all**; re-decoding that 0.64s window returns only the
  tail of the previous sentence. Two defences, both now permanent:
  - `scripts/validate-captions.py` gates publishing. It BLOCKS any cue
    of >=25 characters faster than **40 chars/sec** (`BLOCK_RATE`;
    brisk human speech peaks near 20, and the worst offender was 106), a
    near-duplicate of its neighbour, or a sub-0.6s echo cue, and marks
    26-40 chars/sec as REVIEW (`REVIEW_RATE`: a careful read, not a
    gate). `build-student-captions.py` repeats the rate and
    near-duplicate detectors and refuses to write a week whose flagged
    cues are neither corrected nor listed under `"verified"` in that
    week's corrections file. Flags are not proof of a hallucination —
    they are a demand to check that cue against audio.
  - `scripts/verify-caption-cue.py` re-decodes the window
    around a cue independently (beam 10, no conditioning, so it cannot
    inherit the original's invention) and prints it beside the current
    text and neighbours. Note the only ffmpeg on the box is Playwright's
    stripped build, which cannot demux mp4 — decode via
    `faster_whisper.audio.decode_audio` and slice the array instead.
  - Transcription now runs `condition_on_previous_text=False` plus
    `hallucination_silence_threshold=2.0` and `repetition_penalty=1.1`.
    Measured effect: the conditioned pass flagged **1.98%** of cues
    across 13 weeks; the first hardened week flagged **zero**. The cost
    is slightly less cross-window consistency, which is a good trade
    against inventing scripture.
- **`public/handouts/week-NN-leader-handout.pdf`** — an **accessible**
  (tagged) PDF for leaders: page 1 is the summary, and after it come the
  **transcript pages** (owner-requested 2026-09-06) — that week's Leader
  Video edited into readable prose, a timestamp beside each paragraph and
  section headings to skim by. Roughly 2-5 pages of transcript per handout;
  week 27 has no Leader Video, so it has no handout at all.
  - The whole pipeline lives in the repo now, so a handout can actually be
    corrected and regenerated: `data/leader-handout-summaries.json` (page 1)
    and `data/leader-transcript-prose.json` (the edited transcript) are
    hand-editable data; `scripts/render-leader-handouts.mjs` renders, and
    `scripts/finalize-handout-pdf.py` stamps /Lang, the XMP+docinfo title
    and DisplayDocTitle **and verifies** every file is tagged, titled and
    language-marked. Both data files stay hand-edited build inputs and the
    handout pipeline is unchanged, but the **edited prose is now served**,
    per week, under `public/prep-transcripts/` — the owner asked for the
    transcript on screen (2026-09-16), so Read Prep reads it out of the same
    JSON rather than a leader having to open the PDF. The `.vtt` is still the
    only copy of the *spoken* words that is published on its own.
  - The prose is *edited for reading* (the owner's choice over verbatim):
    spoken grammar repaired, filler and false starts removed, every point,
    example and Scripture reference kept. Two rules exist because an error
    that flickers past in a caption is permanent in print: an editor may
    repair a misheard word only when context makes the intended one
    unambiguous, and must **never** guess at a proper noun or a Scripture
    reference (leave the oddity instead). Every week was then re-checked
    against its own VTT by a second pass. When the leader captions were
    redone at large-v3 (2026-09-06) the prose, the page-1 summaries and the
    teaching-slide notes were re-checked against a word-level diff of old
    vs new transcript, week by week: 48 prose edits and one summary key
    point changed, no slide bullet needed to. Two lessons from that pass:
    the newer decode is not automatically right (where its wording was
    itself odd — "green until my shirt is black" — the old reading was
    kept), and drafting agents drift toward restyling; only edits traceable
    to a specific diff hunk were accepted.
  - `scripts/validate-transcript-prose.py` gates it mechanically, because
    proofreading cannot catch these: paragraphs must **tile the cue numbers**
    1..lastCue with no gap (a dropped passage shows up as a gap), the edited
    text must stay above half the spoken word count (below that it was
    summarized, not edited), and **every book of the Bible named in the prose
    must also appear in the transcript** — which is what catches an invented
    or "tidied-up" citation. Run it before rendering.
  - **`@page` carries the margins, not `body` padding.** Body padding only
    insets the first page's top and the last page's bottom, so with the old
    single-page CSS the new transcript pages ran to the paper's edge.
- **The old one-page description, for context** — page 1 is still exactly
  this: a summary of each Leader Video for leaders:
  Big Idea, Key Points, Scripture, Discussion Questions, plus the
  trademark/internal-use footer. Generated from semantic HTML via
  Chromium `page.pdf({ tagged: true })` (real structure tags), then a
  pikepdf pass sets `/Lang`, XMP+docinfo title, and
  `DisplayDocTitle` — verify any regenerated file is still 1 page,
  tagged, titled, and language-marked before committing. Content is
  written from the transcript, not invented — scripture references only
  where the video actually cites them.
- **`public/leader-prep.json` — the same page-1 summary as *text*** (the
  "Read Prep" overlay, `#prep-view`). A PDF in an iframe is right on the TV
  and wrong on a phone, which is where a leader actually preps; this renders
  Big Idea / Key Points / Scripture / Discussion Questions as real DOM, so it
  reflows on any screen and — being one ~58KB same-origin file, loaded
  cache-first out of `journey-assets-v1` and warmed at startup like
  `lessons.json` and `teaching-slides.json` — it opens with the network dead,
  which the streamed PDF cannot do for a non-current week.
  `scripts/build-leader-prep.mjs` GENERATES it (`npm run build-leader-prep`);
  `render-leader-handouts.mjs` calls the same writer, so the served copy
  can't drift from the handouts. `data/leader-handout-summaries.json` remains
  the single hand-edited source and stays a build input — only the summaries
  travel, because those are this church's own writing about each video. Week
  27 has no Leader Video, so it has no entry, and the overlay says exactly
  that rather than showing a blank panel. Nothing is ever added to this file:
  it is warmed at startup for all 31 weeks, so it has to stay small.
- **The transcript inside Read Prep** (owner-requested 2026-09-16). Under the
  summary, collapsed behind one "Read the full transcript" button, every prep
  carries that video's whole transcript in two versions: **Edited** (the same
  prose the handout prints) and **Exact words** (the verbatim cue text).
  Per-device preference `journey.prep.transcriptMode`, read with the same
  try/catch shape as the caption prefs. Both versions live in the one file, so
  switching repaints from memory and fetches nothing.
  - `scripts/build-prep-transcripts.mjs` (`npm run build-prep-transcripts`)
    writes `public/prep-transcripts/week-NN-<role>.json` for BOTH roles from
    `data/<role>-transcript-prose.json` and that week's VTT.
    `build-leader-prep.mjs` chains it, so `render-leader-handouts.mjs` keeps
    all the served copies in step for free. It is gated by
    `validate-transcript-prose.py`, which grew `--role`/`--prose` for the
    student side: a role whose prose fails is NOT written, because a gap in
    the paragraph tiling means a dropped passage and half a transcript in
    front of a leader is worse than none. A role whose prose file does not
    exist is skipped quietly.
  - **Per-week files**, not one big one, for the same reason leader-prep.json
    carries only summaries: a transcript is tens of KB and is fetched only
    when a leader actually expands one. The current week's two files ride
    `cacheLessonBundle()`, so tonight's lesson reads with the network dead;
    any other week is fetched cache-first through `fetchWithTimeout` (5s) and
    stored in `journey-assets-v1` only after it parses. A failure is never
    memoized, or one bad evening would cost a 24/7 kiosk that transcript
    until a reload.
  - **`data/student-transcript-prose.json`** is the Student Video's half, the
    same schema and 32 weeks (owner-requested 2026-09-16, same licensing
    character as the leader prose: this church's own editing of a video it is
    licensed to show, for its own leaders, never linked elsewhere).
  - Each paragraph keeps the printed handout's **timestamp as a real button**
    in a hanging margin (above the paragraph below 600px). Pressing one
    closes the overlay and starts that role's video there, through the same
    `playLeaderPreview()` / `playStudentPreview()` the picker uses. The seek
    is armed as `pendingSeek` only AFTER `startPreview()` has bumped
    `journeyRequestToken`, so the one permanent `loadedmetadata` listener
    applies it and a superseded request can never seek a newer video.
    Acknowledge-first holds: the overlay closes and the loading overlay
    appears before anything is fetched.
- **Picker flow:** lesson → Student/Leader → Student: Watch Video / Read Prep,
  Leader: Watch Video / View Handout / Read Prep. Both roles ask the second
  question now; only the Leader side has a handout. A **Student Read Prep has
  no summary at all** (the summaries are written from the Leader Video, so
  showing them there would credit the wrong video): one line saying so, and
  the transcript expanded already. The handout opens in a full-screen
  iframe overlay (`#handout-view`, Chromium's built-in PDF viewer) so
  the kiosk never leaves the page; closing it detaches the iframe
  `src` (512MB-Pi memory hygiene). `#prep-view` is the same shape with our
  own DOM (emptied on close for the same reason, and Escape closes it).
  Both count as "a reading overlay is up" via `readerOverlayOpen()`, which
  is what keeps the playback and Settings keyboard shortcuts inert while
  either is covering the screen.

### Teaching slides after the video (owner-requested 2026-09-06)

Every Advocates lesson also ships a 5-slide **Teaching Slides** `.pptx`
on the course page (title, core verse, misconception, illumination, and
a blank **TEMPLATE** — a heading over three empty bullets — for the
leader to fill in). The kiosk shows them after any lesson video ends,
scheduled show or picker preview, before falling back to whatever the
video's ending used to do.

- **Owner-approved licensing extension (2026-09-06):** slides 1-4 of
  every deck are rendered to 1280x960 JPEGs in `public/slides/week-NN/`
  (~15MB for the whole course), plus each deck's template background as
  `template.jpg`. Same character as the re-encoded videos: kiosk-only
  copies, never linked or advertised elsewhere. The owner chose
  "all 32 weeks in the site itself" over nightly-current-week or a
  Release, so the current week's slides pre-download with the bundle and
  the picker can show any week offline-capable.
- `scripts/render-teaching-slides.py` is the reproducible pipeline
  (LibreOffice Impress → PDF → pypdfium2 → JPEG; extracts the template's
  largest referenced image as the background). It refuses a deck that
  isn't exactly 5 slides — all 32 were on 2026-09-06. Weeks 3 and 4
  really do have a doubled `.pptx.pptx` extension on Awana's side.
  **It refuses to run without Carlito and Liberation Sans** (the
  metric-compatible stand-ins for the decks' Calibri and Arial): the first
  render was done without them, LibreOffice fell back to DejaVu Sans, and
  on two dozen slides the wider face pushed the last line of body text off
  the bottom of the picture (owner-reported 2026-09-16 from week 2's
  misconception slide). All 32 decks were re-rendered with the right fonts
  that day; the template backgrounds were unaffected. If a slide ever looks
  cut off again, check `fc-match Calibri` before suspecting the deck.
- `public/teaching-slides.json` — `{ version, sourceUrl, headings,
  weeks: { "N": { title, deckUrl, slides, notes } } }`. `notes` is the
  generated fill for the TEMPLATE slide, three kinds × three bullets:
  `questions` ("Talk About It" — discussion questions addressed to the
  students), `takeaways` ("Remember This"), `challenges` ("This Week").
  Written from each week's **Leader Video transcript** (week 27, which
  has no Leader Video, from the Student transcript), every bullet grounded
  in what the video says, ≤80 characters, then adversarially re-checked
  against the transcript by a second pass. Hand-edit the JSON to correct
  wording; the kiosk renders these as HTML text over `template.jpg`
  (`#slide-template` in style.css mirrors the deck: centered heading,
  three left-aligned bullets, white on the texture) so they stay crisp
  and editable — the only slide we *fill in*, never an image we copy.
- **A leader can rewrite tonight's three bullets on the kiosk itself**
  (Settings → "Edit tonight's bullets"): nine textareas, prefilled from
  `teaching-slides.json`, stored per device under
  `journey.slides.notesOverride` as `{ "<week>": { questions|takeaways|
  challenges: […] } }` and preferred by `slideNotesFor()`, which
  `buildSlideItems()` now reads instead of `notes` directly. Rules that
  matter: `public/teaching-slides.json` is never written — it stays the
  canonical hand-edited source, and only the kinds that actually **differ**
  from it are stored, so a later JSON correction still reaches every kind the
  leader left alone. Clearing all three lines of a kind falls back to the
  written bullets (the tick boxes are how you drop a slide). Bullets are
  capped at 80 characters and 3 per kind, on the way in *and* on the way out
  of storage. Only the currently-resolved week is editable, and the editor
  names it, because "tonight's" has to be unambiguous about what Reset
  undoes. Nothing marks an override **on the slide** (the wall must look the
  same either way), so Settings carries an "Edited on this device" badge
  — visible without opening the disclosure — plus a Reset; and a write
  that *fails* (kiosk storage blocked) says so rather than claiming "Saved",
  because the slideshow reads the override back out of storage, so an edit
  that could not be stored did not take. The Space/→ "begin the lesson"
  shortcut now also requires the Settings panel closed and no text field
  focused: with real textareas on the page, a space between two words must
  stay a space.
- **The deck can also be reached WITHOUT the video** (owner request
  2026-09-16), because some weeks the room has already watched the lesson or
  there is no time for it, and the slides are the part the leader needs.
  Two entry points, both landing on the same `startTeachingSlides()`:
  - **On the 6:30 splash**: a quieter secondary button, "Skip to slides",
    beside Begin Video / Resume / Start over (it never replaces them), and
    **Shift+→** (`skipToTeachingSlides()`). Plain → still begins the video,
    deliberately: a reflexive tap must never skip a lesson, which is the
    same reason Space stays "pause" during playback. Gated exactly like
    Begin Video (`isAwaitingPlay()` plus the Settings panel closed and no
    text field focused), repeats ignored, nothing awaited before the stage
    appears, and `journeyVideo.src` is never set at all. It runs in the
    SCHEDULED (non-preview) mode, so Finish hands back to the Check-in
    Display exactly as it does after a video, and it clears
    `journey.resume` because the lesson is being called done, which is what
    `finishTeachingSlides()` does at the other end of the same show.
  - **In the picker**: a third first-level choice, "Teaching slides",
    beside Student / Leader, enabled for every week including 27 (the deck
    exists whether or not a Leader Video does). `startSlidesPreview()` runs
    it in `previewMode` with `previewWeek` set, so the right deck shows,
    Finish runs `endPreview()`, the poll and the hourly refresh stay out of
    the way, and ⇄ tears it down through `stopJourneyContent()`.
  The splash hint line now reads "Space / → begin · Shift+→ slides ·
  S settings" and is still hidden on touch-only devices.
- **Four ways in from a video, never just `ended`** (`endOfLessonHandoff()`):
  the video's own `ended` event, the near-end stall watchdog, a manual → ,
  and a fatal video error all funnel through one handoff. Hanging the slides off
  `ended` alone stranded a leader mid-club on 2026-09-06: the lesson wedged
  on its last chunk over church WiFi, `ended` never fired, and the room sat
  on a frozen final frame under "Loading video…" with no way to reach the
  slides. So: a stall that is still stuck after `LOADING_STALL_MS` **and**
  within `END_STALL_TOLERANCE_S` of the end is treated as finished; **→**
  hands over from a video that is playing, paused or wedged (Space stays
  "pause", so a reflexive tap can't skip a lesson); and a video that errors
  outright shows the slides rather than the dead placeholder. Test the
  triggers, not just `startTeachingSlides()` — the original suite called
  that function directly, which is exactly why this shipped broken.
- **Playback** (`startTeachingSlides()` in schedule.js): the video is
  released (same memory hygiene as `stopJourneyContent()`), the deck's
  slides show in a 4:3 stage (pillarboxed on the TV), then whichever
  generated slides Settings has ticked. Leader-driven: Space / → / Enter
  next, ← back, tap the slide (left third = back), or the Prev/Next bar
  (fades with the idle cursor like the video bar). "Finish" on the last
  slide runs the old end-of-video behavior (Check-in Display for the
  scheduled show, `endPreview()` for a preview). `stopJourneyContent()`
  tears it down, so the ⇄ button and the 7:15 boundary work unchanged;
  `showJourneyContent()` treats a running slideshow like a playing video
  (no splash over it). A preview remembers its week (`previewWeek`) so a
  Leader/Student preview shows *that* lesson's slides.
- **Settings → "After the video: teaching slides"**: auto-advance
  interval (off = manual, 15s–2min; any manual step resets the timer) and
  three checkboxes for which generated slides to append. Persisted per
  device in localStorage (`journey.slides.autoAdvanceSec`,
  `journey.slides.extras`), like the caption choice. The splash hint now
  reads "Space / → · S for settings" — **S** opens Settings from anywhere
  (not while typing in a field), Escape closes it.
- The current week's slide images + template are part of the prefetched
  bundle (`cacheLessonBundle()`), and `teaching-slides.json` is
  cache-first in `journey-assets-v1` like `lessons.json`, so the whole
  post-video show works with the network dead. A slide image that fails
  to load skips ahead (bounded) rather than sitting on black.

### Manual video preview (Settings panel)

A third corner button (`#settings-btn`, top-right, same subtle style as
the other two; stacked above the toggle while the Check-in Display shows,
see "The corner-button contract" under "Embedding note") opens a panel
listing every lesson in `lessons.json`, so an operator can play any week on
demand — for testing, previewing an
upcoming lesson, or catching up after a missed night.

- **Always a one-off.** Picking a lesson plays it immediately and never
  writes to `current-lesson.json` or touches `currentLesson` — the
  6:30 auto-schedule is completely unaffected by what was manually
  previewed, by design (confirmed: crossing the 6:30/7:15 boundary
  mid-preview doesn't interrupt it, and ending a preview afterward
  correctly resumes the real auto-resolved lesson, not the previewed
  one).
- **Plays the pre-transcoded 480p Release asset** on the low profile
  (`transcodedPreviewUrl()` in `schedule.js` →
  `videos/week-NN-{student,leader}.mp4` on this site),
  falling back to the original URL once if that asset errors. On the full
  profile it is the other way round: the original, with the Release copy
  as the one-shot fallback (`previewSources()`). An
  earlier version played the originals directly as an "accepted
  trade-off" — but the Pi Zero can't decode 1080p at a watchable frame
  rate at all, so every non-current week was effectively unplayable
  (reported broken from the live kiosk; the owner then approved the
  batch-transcode extension above). Still bypasses the Cache API — an
  occasional manual action doesn't need the nightly lesson's
  pre-caching machinery, it just needs a decodable file.
- **Picking a lesson always asks Leader or Student Video first.** An
  earlier version skipped the question inside the 6:30-7:15 window
  (playing the Student Video directly, like the scheduled show) as a
  deliberate distinction — but in practice the two behaviors read as
  the picker being flaky, not as a rule ("it's not asking me
  consistently" — reported from the live kiosk 2026-08-22), so the
  choice is now unconditional. Lessons with no Leader Video
  (`leaderDownloadUrl: null` — currently only week 27) disable that
  choice rather than offering a dead link.
- **`previewMode`** (in `schedule.js`) is the flag that makes this
  safe: the 15s scheduler poll and the hourly lesson refresh both
  no-op while it's set, so neither can interrupt an active preview or
  silently swap its video out from under it. It's cleared, and control
  handed back to `setView(scheduledPhase())`, when the preview's video
  ends/errors or the operator taps the view-toggle button (deliberately
  reused rather than adding a fourth button) — never anything else.

### Room settings sync (`public/src/sync.js`, owner-requested 2026-10-01)

The Awana screens share one always-on sync service (the Awana Check-in
Display repo's `worker/`; its `CLAUDE.md` "The sync service" and
`worker/README.md`). Settings → **Sync** signs this kiosk in with the church
passphrase, and then the ROOM settings follow every Journey screen: captions
on/off (`journey.captions`, applied at the next video), caption size and
backdrop, the teaching slides' auto-advance and extras, and tonight's edited
bullets (`journey.slides.notesOverride`). **Video quality and the prep
transcript choice never travel** (they belong to the device and the leader);
the service's allowlist (`sanitizeJourney` in that repo's
`src/lib/syncSpecs.js`) drops anything else.

- Its own classic script, loaded after `schedule.js`, which it only touches
  through `applyCaptionDisplayPrefs()` / `syncSlidesPrefInputs()` on `window`.
  Stamped like the rest (`STAMPED_ASSETS`).
- The sign-in uses the lobby signage's own slots (`awanaSyncSession.v1`,
  `awanaDisplayKey.v1`, and `awanaConfig.v1`'s Pusher key if it has none):
  this page and the embedded Check-in Display share an origin, so one sign-in
  sets both up, and the iframe is reloaded once to pick it up.
- Pi-light: one fetch at start, one every ten minutes and on `online`, and one
  PUT a second after a change in the Settings card or a CC press (only when
  the room's values actually differ). A 401 means the passphrase was changed:
  the session is dropped and the panel says so.
- Hidden, and silent, until the display site's `shared/sync.json` names a
  service. `test/sync.test.mjs` boots the real page with a stand-in service.

## Embedding note

The Awana Check-in Display (`https://patrick-simpson.github.io/Awana-Check-in-Display/`)
has no `X-Frame-Options`/CSP restriction, so it embeds fine in
`#checkin-view`'s iframe. If that ever changes, this page would need a
different integration approach (e.g. redirecting instead of embedding).

`?lowPower=1` scopes reduced animations to *this* embed (that sibling
app's own signage runs on far more powerful devices too, so its
confetti/motion defaults stay full-strength). It is no longer a fixed
part of the URL: `index.html` ships the low-power URL as the static
`src`, so a browser with JavaScript off still shows something, and
`applyCheckinDisplayUrl()` rewrites it at startup from
`effectiveProfile()` (see "Device profile") to the same URL with or
without the flag. The Pi still gets it; a Mac does not. The rewrite only
happens when the URL actually differs, because re-assigning `src` reloads
the iframe and drops the display's live check-in socket for nothing. See
that repo's `src/lib/urlFlags.js` and `CLAUDE.md` before changing this.

**The fullscreen message contract.** A double-click inside the iframe is
cross-origin and never reaches this document, so the display posts
`{ type: 'awana-display:toggle-fullscreen' }` to `window.parent` when it
is embedded, instead of fullscreening its own stage. This page toggles
fullscreen on `document.documentElement` (never on the iframe or the
`<video>`: fullscreening either would take the ⇄ and ⚙ buttons off the
screen with it), and accepts the message only when `event.source` is its
own iframe's `contentWindow` **and** `event.origin` is the display's
origin or this page's own. A double-click on `#journey-view` does the
same thing locally, inert over a control, a text field, the settings
panel or a reading overlay.

**The corner-button contract.** The ⇄ toggle and the ⚙ gear float over the
Check-in Display's iframe all through the check-in phase, and a frame can
never paint over its parent: live on 2026-09-29 the toggle covered the last
digit of the lobby's RIGHT NOW clock at 720p and the gear the end of its
OVERCAST chip at 1080p. The two sides now agree on one place for the
buttons. While the display shows, the gear stacks 8px above the toggle
(`#checkin-view:not(.hidden) ~ #settings-btn` in `style.css`, no script),
so both sit in ONE 48px column in the bottom-right corner, `max(3vw, 24px)`
in from the right edge, the toggle `max(3vh, 24px)` up from the bottom. The
display, finding itself framed (`window.self !== window.top`), keeps its
corner chip, its tonight ticker, a long child's name and its own operator
panels (Settings, the slide editor, the debug panel, the first-run card) out
of that column (its `src/lib/embed.js` and the `html.embedded` rules in its
`app.css`): a click in the column always lands on these buttons, so before
the display's panels kept out, a click on the right end of its Settings SAVE
at 640x480 opened this page's settings panel instead. README.md's "Previewing
Any Lesson" tells the operator where the gear is in each view.
The display's top-right is its own: its status sticker and weather chip are
measured to the pixel there against the headline under them and the notice
band beside them, so they have nowhere to go (moved down under a button, a
tall sticker ran into the headline on the Pi; moved left, the widest weather
chip ran into the band). So the gear leaves it, and only while the display
shows: over the lesson, the splash and the slides it keeps the top-right. Both buttons stay in the page's tab order (toggle, then gear)
and keep their size and chip style.
`test/corner-buttons.test.mjs` pins the column and the top-right, and that
the frame fills the viewport from 0,0 (so the display's 1vw is ours), in
Chromium at 592x432, 640x480, 720p and 1080p. Nothing crosses the wire and
the iframe URL is unchanged. If the buttons ever move, grow or get a sibling
over the frame, change the display's `HOST_CONTROL` (`src/lib/embed.js`), its
`html.embedded` rules and its `e2e/embedHost.js` in step, and land the
display first: until it knows, a button in a new place sits on its chips.
