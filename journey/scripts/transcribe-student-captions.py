"""High-quality lesson-video transcription for on-screen captions.

Usage: transcribe-student-captions.py [student|leader]   (default: student)

Differences from the Leader pass (transcribe-all.py), all in service of
"near-perfect captions for students":
  * model large-v3 (not small) -- measured materially more accurate on this
    material (e.g. "They're answers" vs "their answers").
  * initial_prompt seeded with this course's domain vocabulary, so proper
    nouns and theological terms (apologia, Areopagus, Sean McDowell, book
    names) aren't mangled into plausible-but-wrong words.
  * word_timestamps -- cues are rebuilt from word timings into caption-sized
    chunks rather than using whisper's long sentence segments, which run up
    to ~135 chars and read terribly on a TV.
Writes cues to a sidecar JSON (reviewable/correctable) plus a .txt for the
contextual review pass; the VTT itself is generated from the JSON afterward
by build-student-vtt.py, so a review never has to touch timing lines.
