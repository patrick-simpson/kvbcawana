"""Gate data/leader-transcript-prose.json before it can be printed.

The prose in that file is an edited rendering of each Leader Video transcript.
Editing spoken words into readable paragraphs is exactly the step where a
model can quietly summarize, drop a passage, or "tidy" a misheard word into a
confident Bible reference the speaker never gave — and unlike a caption that
flickers past, a printed handout makes that permanent. These checks are
mechanical, so they catch what proofreading misses:

  COVERAGE   paragraphs must tile cues 1..lastCue with no gap or overlap, and
             lastCue must be the real final cue of the VTT. A dropped passage
             shows up here as a gap.
  LENGTH     edited words vs spoken words. Removing filler trims maybe a
             quarter; anything under HALF means it was summarized, not edited.
  SCRIPTURE  every book of the Bible named in the prose must also appear in
             the transcript. Catches an invented or "corrected" citation.
  SHAPE      non-empty paragraphs, a heading on the first one, a sane number
             of headings.

Usage: python3 scripts/validate-transcript-prose.py [--role leader|student] [--prose PATH]
  --role   which video's VTTs to check against (default leader; student checks
           data/student-transcript-prose.json against week-NN-student.vtt)
  --prose  override the prose file (e.g. a draft before it is merged)
Exit status is non-zero if anything fails, so it can gate the render step.
