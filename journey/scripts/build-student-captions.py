"""Build public/transcripts/week-NN-{student,leader}.vtt from reviewed cue JSON.

Usage: build-student-captions.py [student|leader]   (default: student)

NOTE ON PATHS: this reads its cue and correction JSON from a working directory
that was scratch space during the original run (see SCRATCH below). Kept in the
repo for reproducibility -- if Awana revises a lesson video, re-run
transcribe-student-captions.py, review, then build -- but point SCRATCH at
wherever that intermediate data lives.


Cue text is written as a SINGLE line with no hard breaks: the kiosk paints
captions into its own overlay with CSS wrapping (text-wrap: balance), so a
break hard-coded at ~42 chars would look wrong on a TV that fits far more.
Letting CSS wrap is what makes one transcript serve both a TV and a phone.
