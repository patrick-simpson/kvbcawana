## [7.14.0] - 2026-10-07
Undo a check-in on TwoTimTwo from the phone.

**New: "Undo check-in" on the phone's Tonight list.** Each child on the list now has an Undo check-in button beside Remove. It asks first, naming the child, and then the check-in laptop undoes the check-in on TwoTimTwo itself, the same undo as the link on TwoTimTwo's check-in report. Only when TwoTimTwo answers "(checkin undone)", and its report no longer lists the child, does the child come off tonight's count and the lobby screens, and the phone says "undone in TwoTimTwo". The child shows up on the laptop's check-in list again, so they can be checked in again later. It works the same on the church Wi-Fi page and on awana.kvbchurch.org/checkin.

**When it cannot.** Nothing changes unless TwoTimTwo confirms it, and the phone says exactly why: phone check-ins are switched off on the laptop ("Allow driven check-ins", which covers undo too), no TwoTimTwo tab is open there (or its extension is older than this one), the laptop is signed out of TwoTimTwo, its TwoTimTwo tab is not the check-in page, or TwoTimTwo refused. The message offers Remove, if you only want the child off tonight's count.

**Remove is unchanged.** It still only takes a child off this laptop's count and the screens, and is the only choice for a child with no TwoTimTwo record (an unregistered visitor), which the row now says. A laptop still on an older print app only removes the child from the count when asked to undo, and the phone says so.

## [7.13.0] - 2026-10-07
Tonight's count is right again, and the screens get it.

**Fixed: 11 children checked in, the count said 2.** The extension reads TwoTimTwo's check-in report to build tonight's count. Since TwoTimTwo moved the child's name into the cell with the edit and undo links (3 October), the extension still read the NEXT cell as the name, and on clubs with a friend / shares / points column that cell says something like "YES 1 Share 1 Point". Every child with the same summary then counted as one child, so the phone page, the dashboard and every lobby screen showed far too few. It now reads the name from the cell with the links, falls back to the roster by TwoTimTwo id, and never takes a "Yes", "No", "Shares" or "Points" cell for a name. Two different TwoTimTwo ids are always two children, whatever the names say.

**Fixed: labels printed as "YES 1 Share 1 Point".** The same misread made the missed-check-in catch-up print labels with that "name". A child whose name cannot be read is now never printed; the catch-up waits until the roster knows them.

**A half-read report is not trusted.** The report's own "Count:" lines say how many children it lists. A read that found fewer is not used for the count (or to mark anyone undone); the count falls back to this laptop's own history and the dashboard says why. An older extension still loaded in Chrome is handled on the laptop side too, but reload the extension (or restart Chrome) to pick this one up.

**The screens catch up.** The count is now sent to the screens every minute from an hour before club starts (it used to start at the club's start time, while children are checked in from 5:20), and a count that failed to reach the sync service is sent again as soon as it answers instead of being dropped. A lobby screen no longer shows last week's final number when it first connects on a club night.

## [7.12.1] - 2026-10-07
The lobby TV no longer shows "FYI: No results found." when TwoTimTwo has no announcement.

**Why.** The extension reads TwoTimTwo's admin messages page. With no message, that page is a table holding one placeholder row, "No results found.", and the one-row fallback took it for an announcement and sent it to the lobby as an FYI. Empty-table placeholders are now ignored, so a screen shows a notice only when the church wrote one.

**What you should notice.** The stray FYI banner stops. Real announcements, including cancellations, show as before.

## [7.12.0] - 2026-10-05
The app now runs on Electron 44 (it was Electron 28).

**Why.** Electron bundles its own copy of Chromium, and Electron 28 stopped receiving Chromium security fixes in 2024. The app ships to the check-in laptop and opens web content (the settings window, the update check), so it should run on a supported Chromium. Electron 44 is the same version the sound room's Awana Lobby Display already uses. The installer builder moves from electron-builder 24 to 26 to match.

**What you should notice.** Nothing. Printing, the settings window, the tray, phone check-in and updates work as before; the print server, the label renderer and its fonts are unchanged. The app still needs Windows 10 or later, as it has since 2023.

## [7.11.1] - 2026-10-05
A stability pass on the check-in laptop: one printing tab, nothing lost when the internet is down, and a dashboard that says what is wrong.

**One TwoTimTwo tab prints.** Every TwoTimTwo tab in the browser used to run the whole extension, each with its own memory of who had printed, so a second tab (the roster opened in a new tab, a browser restore) printed its own copy of every label. Now exactly one tab prints and the others say so in their status line; if that tab is closed the next one takes over, and the "already printed" memory is shared across tabs and starts fresh each club night. A phone check-in is likewise claimed by one tab before it is driven, so two tabs never drive the same child.

**The internet going out no longer backs things up.** With the Wi-Fi up and the internet down, every live frame to the screens waited its full timeout behind the one before it, so a rush built a backlog that took half an hour to drain. The queue now has limits: only the newest tally or recap waits, a check-in older than two minutes is left to the recap, and after three failures in a row the print app stops trying for 30 seconds. The dashboard shows a warning while that is happening, and another whenever a file (the print history, the attendance ledger, the leaders) could not be saved. Labels print throughout.

**Tonight's history is never cut short.** The print history kept its newest 200 rows whatever the day, so on a night with more than 200 labels the first arrivals fell out of it before the evening ended, and tonight's count, the reprint list and the trophy band's "already banded tonight" memory came up short. Rows from today are now always kept.

**Smaller and faster.** Club logos are kept once (the history file was carrying a copy of the logo in every row: megabytes, re-read on nearly every request); the history, the attendance ledger and the roster are held in memory and re-read only when their file changes; a logo is prepared for the thermal printer once per night instead of per label; a worksheet print no longer leaves Windows' default printer switched; the Pusher client, the club-logo download and the sync relay all have timeouts and limits.

**Also.** "Printer jammed" tapped twice no longer runs two reprints at once (the second tap is told the first is still going); the recap sent to the screens is tonight's check-ins only, never last week's; the "new kid" sparkle ends on the right night across a daylight-saving change; an older version in the update feed is never offered as an update; award slips and handbook worksheets are marked done only once the print app accepted them; a youth check-out TwoTimTwo refuses is tried three times a night, not every 30 seconds; the 5:40 to 6:00 page refresh works again (it was checking for an element that is always present) and waits while anything is printing; an auto-start with the port busy no longer waits on a dialog nobody is there to click; a failed update install no longer blocks the next one; awana.kvbchurch.org is allowed to publish the deck and shared settings to this laptop.

## [7.11.0] - 2026-10-04
A phone check-in is "checked in" only when TwoTimTwo says so.

**Fixed: the phone said checked in, TwoTimTwo had nothing.** A check-in made from a phone (awana.kvbchurch.org/checkin or the Wi-Fi page) could show a green "is checked in" line, and print the label, while TwoTimTwo had not recorded the child. Two causes, both on the check-in laptop's extension. It judged TwoTimTwo's reply by whether the child's first name appeared anywhere in it, which a whole page passes too (a refused post or a signed-out session answered with the check-in page lists every name on the roster). And it posted the meeting id the check-in page was loaded with; that tab stays open for days, so by club night the post carried last week's meeting and TwoTimTwo filed the check-in there, or refused it.

**What it does now.** A reply counts only when it is TwoTimTwo's own short answer naming the child, never a page or a login form. Every direct check-in (phone, the touch screen, Quick Mode) starts from a copy of the page no older than five minutes, and a refusal re-reads the page and posts once more. Then, before the phone is told anything, the extension reads TwoTimTwo's own check-in report: the green line comes only when the report lists the child. If it does not, the child goes back on the laptop's list and the phone says "TwoTimTwo did not record the check-in. Check in at the desk." A child whose label printed but who is still on the list is checked in rather than reported "already in".

**The dashboard's "Allow driven check-ins" switch.** With it off, a phone check-in used to wait 90 seconds and then say the laptop was not answering; it now says at once that phone check-ins are turned off on the laptop, and where the switch is.

## [7.10.0] - 2026-10-03
A Trek & Journey phone page for the youth leaders, and Trek and Journey are checked out at 7:15.

**Trek & Journey page.** awana.kvbchurch.org/checkin/ym (any network, the sync passphrase) and /phone/ym on the church Wi-Fi (the phone PIN) are the phone check-in for Trek and Journey only: their families and children, the child's card and the family page, and nothing else (no Tonight, no labels, no Printer jammed).

**Automatic check-out at 7:15.** On a club night, from 7:15 PM the check-in page checks every Trek and Journey child out in TwoTimTwo, every 30 seconds until the night ends, so a child who arrives after 7:15 is checked out within half a minute. Each child is checked out once a night. The time and clubs can be changed (or the check-out turned off) in the church config's `ymCheckout`.

**Signed-in pages no longer read as signed out.** Every TwoTimTwo page carries the words "Login Required" in its script, and the print app took that to mean it was signed out, so it never read the check-in report. It now looks for the sign-in form itself. That brings back what reads the report: tonight's count from TwoTimTwo, the missed-label check (which prints a label for a check-in that never printed one, at most five at a time), club points and the pick-up board's list.

## [7.9.0] - 2026-10-03
Phone check-in from anywhere: awana.kvbchurch.org/checkin. And the laptop's touch screen stays live while you search.

**awana.kvbchurch.org/checkin.** The phone page now works from any phone on any network, not only the church Wi-Fi. Open awana.kvbchurch.org/checkin and type the sync passphrase (the one the lobby screens sign in with); everything the Wi-Fi page does works there: families, search, the child's card with Bible ticked, brothers and sisters, Tonight with Remove and Add back, Printer jammed, and the leader, custom and visitor labels. Each request travels through the sync service to the check-in laptop, which carries it out exactly as for a phone on the Wi-Fi and sends the answer back, usually within two or three seconds. So the laptop must be on, signed in to the sync service (the dashboard's Sync setting), with the TwoTimTwo check-in page open; if it isn't, the page says the check-in laptop is not answering. The church-Wi-Fi page (the Phones address, PIN as before) keeps working as a fallback when the internet is down.

**Nothing stored online.** The sync service keeps no roster: a request waits at most 45 seconds for the laptop, and an answer (which can hold children's names) at most two minutes for its phone, and is deleted the moment the phone reads it. Only the phone page's own requests can travel this way; the laptop checks the same list again before running anything, and asks for requests every 20 seconds, or every second while a phone has been busy in the last five minutes.

**The laptop's touch screen follows phones live.** A child checked in from a phone (or the panel) now drops out of an open search within three seconds, the same as from the families list, and the "checked in tonight" count refreshes every 15 seconds, phones' check-ins included. Only an open child's card or family page holds the screen still.

## [7.8.0] - 2026-10-03
The phone check-in, rebuilt as the touch check-in.

**It looks and works like the laptop's touch screen.** The phone page (the Phones address on the Club Label Printer window, PIN as before) opens on the families still to come, two to a row, each with their children and club colours, and the families not here the last two club nights as small buttons at the bottom. Typing shows matching families first, then the matching children on their own panel, "Did you mean" families for a misspelling, and away families last. A child's card has Bible ticked where the club has it (and Brought a friend); Check in goes straight back to the list while the check-in finishes on the check-in laptop, and a green line says when it is through (a failure says so in red, and the child comes back). Brothers and sisters get their own page, one tap each or "All of them". The same joyful jelly motion as the touch screen: tiles land and settle, survivors glide while you type, a checked-in family pops out of the list.

**Everything else is one tap away.** The "N in" pill at the top opens Tonight: the count by club, the check against TwoTimTwo, and the list with Remove (and Add back on the child's card). The + button holds Printer jammed (while the Star is the printer), Leader tag (with the remembered leaders), Custom label and Visitor label. The old "Not here" tab is the families list itself.

**The same families as the laptop.** The phone uses the household groupings and Bible / Brought a friend clubs the check-in laptop shares with the print app (7.7.0), and its search and family grouping are the touch screen's own code, copied verbatim (scripts/sync-touch-core.cjs) and pinned equal by a test.

## [7.7.0] - 2026-10-03
On the Star receipt printer, a late family gets one drop-off tag.

**The drop-off tag.** When a child checks in late (more than the lateness grace, 10 minutes by default, after their club's first time slot) and the Star receipt printer is the name tag printer, their name tag no longer carries a "Go to:" line. Instead, right after it, the family gets one more tag: "DROP-OFF LOCATIONS AT 6:42 PM" across the top, then a line for every child in the household, each with where their club is at that moment, from the club schedule ("Bobby · Fellowship Hall · Games"). It prints once per family per night, with the first late child; brothers and sisters checking in after that get their name tags only. The household is TwoTimTwo's (see below); a child it doesn't place gets a tag of their own. With the 4×2 label printer nothing changes: the late child's label keeps its "Go to:" line.

**How the print app knows the families.** The check-in laptop's extension, which can read TwoTimTwo, now hands the print app the household groupings (children's names only) and which clubs' check-in has Bible and Brought a friend, when the check-in page loads and every half hour. The print app keeps the last copy on disk, and only the laptop itself can set it. A check-in sent from a phone now also carries Bible and Brought a friend through to TwoTimTwo.

Also on the touch screen: a child who is a family of one shows once in search results (their family card), not again on the Children panel.

## [7.6.0] - 2026-10-03
Touch check-in: search shows families first, Bible starts ticked, and the motion is quicker and more joyful. Also fixes check-ins made from the panel and from phones being repeated.

**Families first when you type.** Typing a name now shows the matching households first, as large family cards (the family's name and every child still to come, with the children the search matched picked out); tapping one opens the family's page. The matching children follow on their own "Children" panel, a misspelling offers "Did you mean" families, and families not here the last two club nights appear only at the very bottom, as small buttons, so a returning family can still be found.

**Bible starts ticked** on a child's card and on a family's page, wherever the club has Bible (Sparks, T&T and Trek on KVBC's page). Untick it for a child who didn't bring one.

**Quicker, more joyful, smoother.** Tiles and cards land in about half a second with a stretch, a squash and one wobble; presses squash harder and spring back faster; the card, the family page and the messages bounce in, and a ticked box pops. Nothing that stays on screen replays its entrance any more: as you type, results that remain glide to their new places and only new ones land; a family you just checked in pops out of the list as it leaves, and the tiles left behind glide to fill the gap.

**Fixed: check-ins from the panel and from phones repeated.** TwoTimTwo keeps a checked-in child's row in the page, hidden. The panel's quick check-in and phone check-ins looked for that row to disappear, so a check-in that had worked looked as if it had not, and the extension opened TwoTimTwo's pop-up and checked the child in again (the source of "may not have stuck" warnings). Hidden rows no longer count, those paths post directly the way the touch screen does (no security token needed), and a phone check-in never opens the pop-up while the touch screen covers the page.

Tested on KVBC's live check-in page: 140 children grouped into 63 families, a family of four checked in with Bible pre-ticked on the three whose clubs have it, back to the list in 0.16 s, then undone.

## [7.5.0] - 2026-10-03
Touch check-in: back to the families the moment you tap, and up to about 70 families on one screen.

**Back at once.** Check in on a child's card, or "All of them" on a family's page, and the screen goes straight back: to the family list, or to the brothers and sisters' page when there is one. The check-ins finish in the background, one at a time, and a green line says when they are through ("Johnson: 3 checked in"). The family leaves the list as soon as you tap; if a check-in fails, a red line names the child and they come back to the list. Checking in each child separately on a family's page now goes back the moment the last one is in, with no pause.

**Up to about 70 families without scrolling.** As the list grows the gaps close up, and once the tiles get small the children's first names give way to a row of club-coloured dots (one per child), so the family's last name keeps the whole tile and stays readable; a tile can go down to 40 px tall. With a long list, the "Not here the last two club nights" row is shorter, with smaller buttons. On a 1366×768 laptop screen, 67 families plus that row fit with nothing to scroll.

## [7.4.2] - 2026-10-03
Touch check-in: check-ins go through on the real TwoTimTwo page.

**The real cause.** TwoTimTwo's check-in page carries no security (CSRF) token, and the extension's quick check-in refused to post without one. So every touch check-in went to the fallback of clicking the child's row, which opened TwoTimTwo's pop-up out of sight behind the touch screen: nothing was recorded, and the hidden pop-ups left the page frozen. 7.4.1 stopped the freezing but still wanted the token, so it would have refused every touch check-in. The quick check-in now posts exactly what TwoTimTwo's own Checkin button posts (the child, the meeting and the check-in items), tested on the live page: a family of four checked in, each confirmed by TwoTimTwo, and TwoTimTwo's own pop-up still opened normally afterwards.

**Children checked in on TwoTimTwo itself drop off the touch screen.** TwoTimTwo hides a checked-in child's row rather than removing it; the touch screen now skips those rows too (it was still listing them as to come), and a touch check-in marks the row the same way TwoTimTwo does.

## [7.4.1] - 2026-10-03
Touch check-in: no more stuck TwoTimTwo page after a few check-ins; the app window checks for updates every 30 seconds; and a new version restarts Chrome on the check-in page by itself.

**What went wrong.** When a quick check-in could not confirm itself (it matched the child's row by its exact name text, which a doubled space or a nickname defeats), it fell back to clicking the row on TwoTimTwo's page. That opened TwoTimTwo's check-in pop-up behind the full-screen touch check-in, where nobody could see it; a few of those stacked up, and after Close their grey backdrop covered the page until it was refreshed.

**Now.** The touch check-in never opens TwoTimTwo's pop-up. It posts the check-in directly, one child at a time, takes TwoTimTwo's own reply as the confirmation, and removes the child's row by its id. If a post is refused, it quietly re-reads the check-in page for a fresh security token and tries once more; if that fails too, it says so in red and the child can be tapped again. Closing the touch check-in clears any pop-up or grey backdrop left on the page and, if anyone was checked in, reloads TwoTimTwo once the tags have gone to the printer, so its own lists start fresh. (It does not reload after every check-in: that would drop out of full screen each time, and only a tap can bring full screen back.) The 5:40 pm peak-window auto-reload waits while the touch check-in is open.

**Updates every 30 seconds while the app's window is open.** The Club Label Printer window now looks for a new version every 30 seconds while it is open and not minimized, and the version line says when it last looked. (The release ping that made updates near-instant went away with Pusher; with the window closed the app still checks at start and once a day.)

**A new version restarts everything by itself, at any hour.** The app already installed its own update within a minute, restarting the print server with it. Now, on the launch that brings a new version, it also closes Chrome (every window) and reopens it on the TwoTimTwo check-in page only, so the new extension is loaded; Chrome's "Restore pages?" prompt is suppressed. If Chrome isn't installed in the usual place, the check-in page opens in the default browser. As a backup, an open check-in tab that sees the new extension on disk also has it re-read its folder and refreshes itself.

## [7.4.0] - 2026-10-03
Touch check-in: a "Printer jammed" button for the Star.

**Printer jammed.** While the Star receipt printer is the selected printer, the touch check-in's top bar has a "Printer jammed" button beside Close. One tap (no confirm) reprints every check-in from the last 60 seconds twice: once on the Star and once on the backup label printer ("If it fails, print on" on the dashboard). If the Star is still jammed, the label printer's copies still come out, and the message says which printer printed. Failed, removed, award and leader rows never reprint, and each child prints once per printer. It is refused while rehearsal mode is armed.

## [7.3.0] - 2026-10-03
Touch check-in: its own Check in button left of Club Print, opening into true full screen with the lobby's jelly motion throughout; families named by their last name alone; and families who haven't come lately in a row of smaller buttons at the bottom.

**The Check in button.** A blue "Check in" pill always sits just left of the panel's corner (the Club Print pill, or the open panel). One tap grows the touch check-in out of the pill into true full screen: no tabs, no address bar. Close, or Escape, gives the screen back. It replaces the "Open touch check-in" button in the panel.

**Jelly, everywhere.** The lobby's soft squish, with its spring exactly (Jelly UI's stiffness 260, damping 17, mass 1, as the lobby's `squish.js` writes it): every press squashes onto its ledge and springs back, tiles, cards and buttons land stretched and settle through a squash, the confirm card, the family page and the "checked in" message spring in, a ticked box pops, and the screen itself grows out of the pill on the same spring. Exits stay quick and plain, as in the lobby; the OS's reduced-motion setting stills all of it.

**Last names.** "Brooks", not "The Brooks family", on the family page; after a check-in the sibling page asks "Johnson: also here tonight?".

**Not here the last two club nights.** A family none of whose children came to either of the last two club nights moves from the tiles to a row of small buttons at the bottom (the name, a dot per child in their club's colour, how many). The row takes at most about a third of the screen and scrolls inside itself; the families above size themselves to the rest. A tap works the same as on a tile. If everyone still to come is in that row, they become the main tiles instead. A club night is any date some child attended (a cancelled week counts against no one), from the print server's attendance ledger, which the Attendance Audit keeps in step with TwoTimTwo. Before there have been two club nights this season, nothing is split.

**For maintainers.** New `GET /touch/recent` (`recentAttendance()` in `server.js`: the last two club nights before today and the ids and names of every child at either), `__awanaTouchApi.recent()` in `content.js`, the split in `touch.js`'s `renderFamilies()`. New checks in `test-server-helpers.cjs`.

## [7.2.0] - 2026-10-03
Touch check-in: whenever the search box is empty, the families still to come fill the screen.

**What shows.** One tile per family with a child not yet checked in: the family's name and, beneath it, only the children still to come, each with a dot in their club's colour (the tile's stripe carries every club). A child TwoTimTwo files with no household, or every child before the household list has loaded, gets a tile of their own with their full name. Families are in alphabetical order; families are never guessed from names.

**Sized to what's left.** The tiles are the largest equal size that fits every family on the screen without scrolling (never narrower than twice their height), so they grow as families arrive; only past about 80 families at 1280 x 800 does the grid scroll at the smallest size. Each name sizes itself to fit its tile on one line. The screen follows the page every 3 seconds, so a child checked in elsewhere leaves without a tap, and it only redraws when the families change.

**Tapping.** A family opens its page (the brothers-and-sisters page: one tap per child, or All of them, Bible and Friend off to start); a child on their own opens their check-in card. Typing a letter swaps to search; clearing it, or finishing a check-in, brings the families back. When nobody is left: "Everyone's checked in!"

**Also.** A hidden message or card no longer leaves a sliver of itself or its shadow at the screen's edge.

**For maintainers.** `groupFamilies()` and `fitTiles()` in `touch.js`'s pure half; new checks in `test-touch-search.cjs` (grouping, naming, the tile fit, and that a tile never shrinks as families leave).

## [7.1.0] - 2026-10-03
Touch check-in: a full-screen, touch-first check-in over the TwoTimTwo check-in page, for the check-in laptop's touchscreen, with a sibling page.

**Opening it.** "Open touch check-in" at the top of the panel's Check in tab. ✕ or Escape closes it; TwoTimTwo is underneath, untouched.

**Search.** Type a first name, a last name, or both in either order; the list follows every letter. A misspelling still finds the child: close names are listed under "Did you mean", best first (letters swapped or one or two off, and the sound-alike spellings parents choose between: Jaxon / Jackson, Caitlin / Kaitlyn). One or two letters only ever match the start of a name. Children already in tonight are shown greyed with their time and cannot be tapped.

**Checking in.** A tap opens the child's card: Bible and Brought a friend (only for clubs whose TwoTimTwo check-in has them), then Check in. Nothing is checked in without that second tap. The check-in goes through the panel's own path, exactly as Quick Mode: the label prints, then the direct check-in to TwoTimTwo, and TwoTimTwo's own check-in window only if that cannot be confirmed.

**Brothers and sisters.** If TwoTimTwo files other children under the same household and they are not in yet, their page slides in: one tap each, or All of them (one at a time, in order). Bible and Friend start as the first child's answers, where their club has them, and each can be unchecked. Done, Escape, or typing the next name closes it. Panel → Settings → "Offer brothers and sisters after a check-in" turns the page off. The household list is read from TwoTimTwo's own Household export (re-read every 30 minutes); only household ids and children's names are kept, in memory on that page, never stored or sent.

**Look.** The brand kit: Paytone One names, Londrina Solid labels, Figtree, a club-colour stripe on every child. Motion is transform and opacity only, and stops under the OS's reduced-motion setting. It draws in its own shadow root, so TwoTimTwo's page and this screen never restyle each other.

**For maintainers.** New `chrome-extension/touch.js` (a second content script after `content.js`): the pure search and household parsing at the top, which `scripts/test-touch-search.cjs` (in `npm test`) loads in Node; the screen below. `content.js` exposes `window.__awanaTouchApi` (`checkIn(recid, {Bible, Friend})`, `tonight()`) in the extensions' isolated world, invisible to TwoTimTwo's page, and its panel search never takes focus while the touch screen is open.

## [7.0.0] - 2026-10-03
Version 7: a new icon, and the extension's panel on the TwoTimTwo check-in page reorganized into a short strip that is always there and four tabs in the order the night goes. (Released as 7.0.0 rather than 6.28.0, at the owner's word.)

**The icon.** A name tag with a green check, on the brand kit's orange (`electron-app/build/icon.svg` is the source; `icon.ico` carries 16 to 256 px, `icon.png` the window and tray). It replaces the plain purple square on the desktop shortcut, the Start menu, the taskbar, the tray and the installer.

**Why.** Options had been added one at a time for years, so the panel was one long column of about fifty controls and seven status lines, and the owner found it hard to follow.

**The layout.**
- **Always at the top**: a dot (green when the print server answers, red when it doesn't) and "Printing to" with a Change link to the dashboard. A problem shows here only while there is one: the print queue backing up, an outdated roster, a server update.
- **Check in** (opens first): search, Quick Mode, Auto-Print / Print Dialog / Off, last prints. The rush never needs to scroll.

## [6.27.0] - 2026-10-03
On a receipt roll the name tag is now the same label the right way up, scaled to the roll's width: about 2⅞″ × 1⅜″, a quarter of the paper. The Label Preview shows the tag the chosen printer will print, at its size.

**Why.** Turned a quarter turn to fill the roll the long way, a tag came out about 2⅞″ × 5⅝″, which the owner found far larger than wanted.

**What prints.** Both receipt connections (USB and network) send the 4×2 label scaled to the printable width (576 × 288 dots at 203 dpi), not turned. The design is unchanged, the no-photo bar included. A 4×2 label printer, and a backup printer, print 4″ × 2″ as before.

**The preview.** `GET /preview` returns what the name tag printer prints: on a receipt roll the 1-bit tag, with `X-Tag-Size` (inches) and `X-Tag-Printer`. The dashboard's Label Preview and the template editor draw it at about actual size, with the size written under it.

**For maintainers.** `rasterizeLabel()` in `receipt.js` scales without turning; `test-receipt.cjs` pins the 576 × 288 raster, the page size (284 × 142 hundredths of an inch) and both previews.

## [6.26.0] - 2026-10-03
One place to choose the printer: the dashboard. The extension's panel on the check-in page shows where labels print, and its Settings page now only points to the dashboard.

**Why.** There were three printer choices (the extension panel's Printer list, the dashboard's Printer box, and the receipt printer box under Printer type), plus an extension Settings page that edited the same Pusher keys as the dashboard. Picking the Star TSP100 in the extension's list printed a 4×2 page on an 80 mm roll, or made the Star its own fallback.

**The dashboard (Settings).**
- **Name tag printer**: the Windows printers and "Receipt printer on the network (by IP address)". For a Windows printer, **4″ × 2″ labels** or **80 mm receipt roll**, guessed from the name as it is picked (Star, TSP, receipt, POS, 80 mm mean a roll). This replaces Printer, Printer type and Receipt printer.
- **If it fails, print on**: optional, empty by default. A receipt printer that reports a problem, or a label printer whose print fails, sends that child's label here, and the dashboard says so (`receiptFallback`, or the new `printerFallback`). A config saved before this keeps its old fallback (the Printer box) until Settings is saved.

**The extension.**
- The panel's Printer list is gone: "Printing to: Star TSP100 Cutter (TSP143) (80 mm roll), backup ..." with a Change link to the dashboard. Prints no longer carry a printer of their own, and a choice this browser saved before is forgotten, so nothing can override the dashboard.
- The Settings page (and the popup's button) opens the dashboard. Its Pusher keys are gone (Pusher is retired); Step Up Night and Awana Store Night stay on the panel, where they already were.
- The panel wears the family's faces, Figtree and Londrina Solid, loaded from the print server's brand kit.

**For maintainers.** `backupPrinter()` and `printingTarget()` in `server.js`; `GET /printers` adds `inUse` `{kind, name, backup}`; `POST /config` takes `backupPrinterName` ('' is no backup; a missing key is a config from before it). New checks in `test-receipt.cjs`.

## [6.25.1] - 2026-10-03
The USB receipt printer can be chosen when Windows names it with parentheses, as the Star driver does ("Star TSP100 Cutter (TSP143)").

**Why.** Send test tag answered "Pick the receipt printer from the list first" with the Star picked, and Save would not keep it: the printer-name check refused `(` and `)`, which Windows uses in driver names and in copies ("(Copy 1)", "(redirected 2)").

**What changes.** `isSafePrinterName()` allows parentheses. Every place a printer name reaches PowerShell it sits in a single-quoted string or an environment variable, where they are plain characters; `$`, quotes, backticks, `;`, `|`, `&`, braces and brackets are still refused, so a subexpression still cannot get through. New checks in `test-server-helpers.cjs`.

## [6.25.0] - 2026-10-03
The receipt-printer trial can now use a USB receipt printer through its Windows driver, such as a Star TSP100 futurePRNT, as well as the network one from 6.19.0.

**Why.** The owner is running the trial on a USB Star TSP100 futurePRNT instead of a network printer. That printer takes only images from Star's Windows driver, not raw ESC/POS commands, so the 6.19.0 network path can't drive it.

**What changes.** Settings → Printer type has a third choice, "Receipt printer (80 mm roll, USB / Windows driver, e.g. Star TSP100) — trial", with its own list for picking the receipt printer from the Windows printers. The tag is the same: today's label turned sideways and scaled to fill the roll, about 2⅞″ × 5⅝″. The driver gets the exact black-and-white dots the network path would send (576 × 1152 at the head's 203 dpi), on a page exactly that size, drawn without smoothing, so the driver has nothing to dither or resample. The cut (full or partial) is set in the printer's own Windows printing preferences.

**Before each tag, Windows is asked about the printer.** If Windows says it isn't installed, is offline, out of paper, has its cover open, is jammed or needs attention, nothing is sent to it. That child's label goes to the 4×2 printer chosen in the Printer box (the same fallback and `receiptFallback` warning as 6.19.0), or the print fails with the reason if there is no 4×2 printer. Low paper raises `receiptPaperLow`. This is only as good as what the driver tells Windows: a printer whose driver reports nothing is treated as fine and gets the tag. The receipt printer is never used as its own fallback, so picking the Star in both boxes fails loudly instead of printing a 4×2 picture on the roll.

**Send test tag** prints on whichever receipt printer the form shows (network or USB) and nowhere else. The network option, Find printers and the cut setting stay exactly as they were for a network printer.

**Setup on the check-in laptop.** In the Star's Windows printing preferences, set the paper to 72 mm × Receipt (so the page ends where the tag does) and choose the cut. Keep the 4×2 printer selected in the main Printer box as the fallback.

**For maintainers.**
- `receipt.js`: `printerType` 'receipt-usb' (`RECEIPT_TYPES`, `isUsb()`, and `usb` / `printerName` in `optionsFrom()`), and `renderTagPng()`, the same 1-bit raster as a PNG.
- `server.js`: `printReceiptWindows()` is one PowerShell run that checks Win32_Printer (`WorkOffline`, `PrinterStatus`, `DetectedErrorState`), exits 3 with `RECEIPT_PROBLEM: <reason>` instead of printing, or prints the tag 1:1 on a custom `PaperSize`. A reported problem is not retried; other errors get the one retry `printImage()` has. `printReceipt()` picks the connection for `printLabel()` and `/receipt/test`. New config key `receiptPrinterName`, validated like `worksheetPrinter`. `/health`'s `receiptPrinter` gains `connection` ('network' / 'usb').
- `test-receipt.cjs` covers it with a fake Windows (a PowerShell stub that reports problems or low paper and keeps the tag it was given): the page size, the 1-bit tag, problems falling back, no fallback to itself, and the test button.

## [6.24.0] - 2026-10-03
A late child's label now says where their club is right now, using the church's printed 2026-27 club schedule out of the box.

**Why.** The schedule table held one place per club, but every club moves during the night (Cubbies are in the Large Classroom at 6:05 and in the Fellowship Hall for games at 7:00), so a label printed at 7:10 sent a child to the wrong room.

**What changes.**
- The schedule is a list of time slots, any number per club: a child checked in after the club's first slot plus the late grace (10 minutes) gets "Go to: <activity>, <place>" for the club's slot that started last, e.g. "Go to: Games, Fellowship Hall" at 7:10.
- With no rows of its own, this computer routes by the church's 2026-27 schedule (Puggles, Cubbies, Sparks, T&T, Trek and Journey, 5:45 to 7:00 slots), and the dashboard shows it filled in. Edit it there; delete every row and save to go back to it. Trek and Journey have their own rows: they part at 7:00 (Trek to the Child Discipleship Wing, Journey in the Youth Building).
- A connect card names the club's slot under way when it prints.
- The table takes up to 60 rows and 40-character place names ("Child Discipleship Wing" was cut off at 20).

**For maintainers.** `DEFAULT_SCHEDULE`, `clubSlots()` and a time-aware `scheduleRowFor(club, now)` in `server.js`; `lateGoToLine` counts the grace from the club's earliest slot. `GET /config` fills in `schedule` with the rows in effect. New checks in `test-server-helpers.cjs`.

## [6.23.0] - 2026-10-02
A child who may not be photographed now gets a solid bar down the label's right edge, as well as the crossed-out camera.

**Why.** The camera is one small icon in a row of them; whoever is taking pictures should be able to tell from across the room, or through a viewfinder, without reading the row.

**What prints.** A bar 1/8 inch wide, top to bottom, flush with the paper's right edge, on exactly the labels that carry the crossed-out camera (the same `noPhoto` flag: reprints and the director's list agree with it). It is black on a white label and white on a black one (stepping up, or an inverted first-timer label), where black would vanish. Everything else on the label (the name, the visitor pill, the icon row) keeps 4 pt clear of it, so it all moves 7 pt in. On a no-photo birthday label with two or more allergies, that leaves no room for the "Turning 7!" words; the cake, the allergy icons and the camera all stay, as they always do when the row is full.

**For maintainers.** `NO_PHOTO_BAR_W` / `NO_PHOTO_CUT` in `server.js`, and a local badge width `bw` inside `generateLabel()` for everything drawn on the badge. `test-label-golden.cjs` checks the bar on white, crowded, step-up and inverted labels (solid, edge to edge, 4 pt clear before it) and that a label without the flag has none; the three baselines with a no-photo child are regenerated. The site's label recreation draws the bar too.

## [6.22.0] - 2026-10-01
The move to awana.kvbchurch.org: updates now come from the church's own site, and every live frame also goes to the sync service's own channel while this computer is signed in.

**Updates.** electron-updater reads https://awana.kvbchurch.org/updates/printer/latest.yml (the generic provider) instead of this repo's GitHub releases, because the printer now lives in the kvbc-awana repo beside the lobby's own Windows app, and two apps cannot share one repo's "Latest" release. The installer itself is still a GitHub release asset. This release is the bridge: the last one from Print-TwoTimTwo-Labels.

**Addresses.** The dashboard and the sync client find the service through awana.kvbchurch.org; the repair dialog, the Install Guide and the extension popup download from awana.kvbchurch.org/download/club-label-printer.

**The live relay.** Every live frame also goes to the sync service's own channel while this computer is signed in (the one-site move, step 3).

**Why.** Screens signed in to the sync service now listen on its live channel instead of Pusher, where only signed-in screens can listen, so arrival timing and headcount stop being public. The names were already sealed and still are.

**How.** `events.setRelay()`: after `publish()` seals a frame, it is also POSTed to the service's `/v1/publish`, one at a time and in order, with the session (`server.js`). Only the display channel's events, never the provision frame. With no Pusher configured at all, the service is the only path. 

## [6.21.0] - 2026-10-01
Sign this computer in to the church's sync service with the same passphrase every screen types, so the screens keep syncing with this computer switched off.

**Why.** The owner wants one word ("kennebec") to set up any screen, and settings, slides and the calendar to stay in step without this laptop being on. The screens now sync through an always-on service (a Cloudflare Worker in the Awana-Check-in-Display repo, `worker/`), and this computer signs in to it like any screen.

**What signing in does.**
- This computer seals check-ins with the key the screens share. On the service's very first sign-in it hands over the key it already had, so screens set up before keep reading names; after that it adopts the service's key.
- The old display login's `provision` frame stops. It sealed the keys under the passphrase on a public channel, where a short word could be guessed offline; the service checks the word online, with guess limits, instead.
- The lobby deck and the shared settings stop being rebroadcast from here, and a publish made on this computer (the dashboard, or the display app on this computer) is forwarded to the service, which is now their one home.
- Check-ins never pass through the service.

**Settings → Sync service** (shown once the display site's `shared/sync.json` names a service, in place of the display login): type the passphrase, **Sign in**. If the passphrase is changed on another screen, the service signs this computer out (it also replaces the key): `/health` and Diagnostics say so in red, and the fix is signing in again with the new word.

**For maintainers.**
- New `print-server/sync-client.js`: the request helpers (`syncLogin`, `syncCheck`, `syncPublish`), no state.
- `server.js`: `POST /config/sync-login` `{passphrase, url}` and `POST /config/sync-logout` (this computer's trusted surface only), `config.syncUrl` / `config.syncSession` (the session is a `SECRET_CONFIG_KEYS` entry), a 10-minute sign-in check, the provision and rebroadcast gates, the forwarding, and `/health.sync` (`signedIn`, `state`, `error`; never the session) and `/health.displayLogin.retired`. Nothing touches the network until someone signs in.
- New `scripts/test-sync.cjs` (in `npm test`) against a stand-in service.

## [6.20.0] - 2026-10-01
Lobby screens share their settings: change one on the check-in computer and every screen follows.

**Why.** The owner wants a Settings change (banner times, celebrations, the pickup board's hours, the season look, the calendar and weather) to reach every lobby screen without walking to each one. Per-screen things (what plays behind the names, uploaded videos and decks, that TV's sound, motion, confetti and wake lock, simplified mode, the connection keys) stay per-screen.

**How.** Exactly the lobby slides' path. The display app's Settings, open on the check-in computer, POSTs the shared set to the new `POST /api/display-settings` (from the display's own origin with the publish token, which the display login already hands out, or from this computer's trusted surface). The server keeps it in `display-settings.json`, and publishes it as one sealed `settings` event, rebroadcast every 5 minutes so a rebooted screen catches up. A screen applies a payload only if its `publishedAt` is newer than the one it holds.

**What can ride it.** Only the keys in one allowlist (`SETTINGS_SPEC` in `events.js`, mirrored in `contract-vectors.json` as `events.settings.keys`), each checked against its rule: switches, clamped numbers, menus, capped plain text, an https calendar URL, `HH:MM` times, a skin id, threshold lists, and up to 15 club lines of 80 characters. Per-screen keys and anything else are dropped. No names ever. The JSON is capped at 3,800 bytes (413 above it, nothing committed), so every frame seals into the 4096 rung.

**For maintainers.**
- Contract v6: `contract-vectors.json` gains `events.settings` and lists `settings` as encrypted; `envelope-vectors.json` is regenerated with its cases (`settings` pads on the `slides` ladder, `[2048, 4096]`, fail closed). Both mirrored into Awana-Check-in-Display, which ships the consumer half in the same change.
- `events.js`: `SETTINGS_SPEC`, `buildDisplaySettings()`, `buildSettingsPayload()`, `displaySettingsJsonBytes()`, `SETTINGS_JSON_MAX`.
- `server.js`: `POST`/`GET /api/display-settings`, the CORS/PNA carve-out now covers both display paths (`DISPLAY_PUBLISH_PATHS`), the 5-minute rebroadcast, and `/health.displaySettings` (`rev`, `publishedAt`, `keyCount`; never the values).
- New `scripts/test-display-settings.cjs` (in `npm test`); `test-contracts.cjs` pins the builder's table to the contract's and the worst case to one frame.

## [6.19.0] - 2026-10-01
A trial option: print every label on an 80 mm network receipt printer (ESC/POS, such as a Rongta with an Ethernet jack) on sticky thermal roll, instead of the 4×2 label printer. Off by default; nothing changes for a church that doesn't turn it on.

**Why.** The owner wants to try kids' name tags on a receipt printer for one club night, as a trial that may not continue. So it's one setting that can be flipped back mid-evening, and nothing about the label itself was redesigned.

**What it prints.** The same label the one renderer draws, turned a quarter turn and scaled up to fill the roll's printable width (576 dots, 72 mm, by default), keeping its 2:1 shape: about 2⅞″ wide and 5⅝″ long, then cut. The label's left edge (where the name starts) comes out first. Black and near-black print solid and near-white prints as bare paper; only the in-between tones are dithered, which is what keeps the colour emoji visible: the yellow allergy warning icon and the birthday cake. A plain black/white cutoff printed the yellow warning icon as blank paper, and dithering everything put a speckled halo round the name.

**How it gets there.** Raw ESC/POS straight to the printer's TCP port 9100: no Windows driver, no PowerShell, no spooler. Before each tag the server asks the printer for its status (DLE EOT); out of paper, cover open or a printer error refuses the job before any of it is sent. A printer that doesn't answer the status query still gets the job, because plenty of models skip it. Tags are sent one at a time, so a batch of siblings prints in order.

**If it fails, the child still gets a label.** If the receipt printer can't be reached or refuses the job, that label goes to the 4×2 printer chosen in Settings, provided Windows says it is installed and not offline, and `/health` and the dashboard raise a `receiptFallback` warning naming the reason. With no 4×2 printer available either, the print fails as any print does (`receiptPrinterFailed` on `/health`, the failures list and its Reprint button). The warning clears on the next good tag. A nearly-empty roll raises `receiptPaperLow`.

**Settings → Printer type.** "Receipt printer (80 mm roll, network) — trial" reveals the printer's IP address and port (9100), the cut (full, the default, or partial, where the tag hangs until torn off) and the printable width in dots. **Find printers** looks for anything answering on port 9100 on this computer's own private networks; **Send test tag** prints a TEST tag on the receipt printer only (never the fallback), using the form's values before you save, and records nothing. Diagnostics gains a "Receipt printer" row.

**What it doesn't do.** No tunes while it's on: a receipt head can't play them, and the fallback printer stays quiet too. The startup blank "prewarm" print is skipped. Each tag starts with a short blank lead (the gap between the print head and the cutter), which receipt printers can't avoid. Every print path (check-ins, reprints, award slips, connect cards, leader tags, custom labels, the canary) goes the same way. The public website doesn't mention it yet; it will if the trial sticks.

**For maintainers.**
- New `print-server/receipt.js`: `rasterizeLabel()` (rotate, scale, mid-tone dither), `buildEscPos()` (ESC @, GS v 0 in 128-row bands, GS V 65/66), `parseStatus()`, the single TCP conversation, the job queue, and `discover()`.
- `server.js`: `printLabel()` replaces direct `printImage()` calls at every label print site; with `printerType` unset it is exactly `printImage()`. New config keys `printerType` ('receipt'; 'label' deletes it), `receiptHost`, `receiptPort`, `receiptDots`, `receiptCut`; defaults delete their keys. New routes `POST /receipt/test` and `POST /receipt/discover` (trusted origin only). `/health` gains `receiptPrinter` (the address only for this computer) and the three `{type, message}` warnings above.
- New `scripts/test-receipt.cjs` (in `npm test`): orientation and scale, the dithering rules, the ESC/POS bands and cut, the status bits, and the whole route against a fake network printer (delivery, paper-out refusal, a status-less printer, fallback, no-fallback failure, silence, the default path unchanged).

## [6.18.1] - 2026-09-30
The Club Print button in the browser extension moves about an inch to the left, off TwoTimTwo's search magnifier.

**What changed.** The extension's collapsed "Club Print" pill (and the panel it opens) is pinned to the top-right of the TwoTimTwo page, and there it sat on top of the site's own search magnifying glass. It is now pinned 12 px + 96 px (about an inch) in from the right edge instead of 12 px, at the same height, so the magnifier is uncovered. Nothing else about the widget changed. As with any extension change, it reaches a check-in PC after the app update and one Chrome restart (the app syncs the extension folder on launch).

## [6.18.0] - 2026-09-29
The labels and the operator's screens change their headline font from Galindo to Paytone One, because the owner said Galindo "looks too much like SpongeBob".

### One font swap, everywhere the printer shouts

**What changed.** The catalog's fonts were Galindo (the shout: the child's first name, the club letter on the monogram badge, a custom label, and the headline of the dashboard, the phone page, the setup pages and the Windows status window), Londrina Solid (the label voice) and Figtree (the read). The shout is now **Paytone One**. Londrina Solid and Figtree stay exactly as they were. The owner chose it from a side-by-side of labels and screens set in the candidates: same weight and warmth, without Galindo's bulging, wavy edges. Every other screen in the family (the lobby signage, the projector, the Journey kiosk) makes the same swap in its own release, from the same kit.

**The whole font ships, unmodified.** Paytone One is SIL Open Font License, and its licence reserves the names "Paytone" and "Paytone One", so a subset or a re-encoded copy may not carry that name. The kit therefore holds the full TTF byte for byte (the printer's canvas uses it) and a WOFF2 built to the OFL's WOFF exception (every table stored untransformed, no metadata), for the pages. The licence text ships beside it. The installer still loads four fonts (Paytone One, Londrina Solid, Londrina Solid Black, Figtree), so its `/health` release check is unchanged.

**Names Galindo could not draw now print in the kit.** Paytone One has Ș, Ț and every precomposed Vietnamese letter, and the whole of Latin Extended-A (Polish, Czech, Turkish and the rest). A child called Ștefan or Thảo used to get their first name in the older Windows font, and a custom label like "Chào mừng Nguyễn Thị Thảo" printed entirely in it. Both are now in the kit. What it still lacks (Cyrillic, Greek, CJK, Arabic, Thai, Devanagari, and a few Latin letters such as the Ewe ɔ) falls back exactly as before: that word, or for a first name or a custom label the whole line, prints in the older font, never with a hole in it. Figtree, which sets the last name, still lacks the precomposed Vietnamese letters, so "Thảo Nguyễn" prints the first name in the kit and the last name in the older font, as each line decides for itself.

**The layout was re-tuned for the new face's shape.** Paytone One's capitals are a little shorter and sit lower in their line, and its descenders are shallower, so at the same size a name would have ridden low and closer to the last name. The first name is now drawn higher in its box and the box was resized, which puts the capitals where Galindo's were and keeps the same clearance above the last name. Paytone One also draws marks and commas far outside its line: the stack on Ấ rises above the top, and the comma of Ș and Ț hangs below the bottom. The label now measures the name's own ink and makes room for it. A mark that rises above the capitals (É, Ấ) takes its room from the paper above the name first and never prints closer than 4 pt to the label's top edge (as close as 6.17.0 ever printed a name); only what that margin cannot give is taken from the rest of the label. On a busy label that shrinks the name by how much the mark needs: a diacritic that fits in the margin (Ö, Ñ) costs almost nothing (about 2% at most), É about a tenth, and the tallest Vietnamese stacks (Ấ, Ẳ) about a fifth. A hanging comma never touches the last name. On the busiest labels of all (a step-up night with a trophy chip, a "Go to" line, a milestone and a twin hint, where the name is already at its 18 pt floor) a mark's or comma's room used to land on the bottom of the label and print the "Stepping up to..." callout over the trophy chip; now the name gives that room back in size instead, at most 4 pt under the floor, so the callout sits exactly where it does for an ordinary name. An ordinary name has nothing to measure and is laid out the same as any other.

**Wrapped custom labels have room for the new face's marks.** Paytone One stacks its Vietnamese marks taller than the line spacing the old bold sans needed: Ấ, Ầ, Ố and Ồ stand 1.19 em above their baseline, Ắ 1.22, and the old spacing was 1.15. So a custom label long enough to wrap, such as "NGƯỜI GIÚP VIỆC BAN THIẾU NHI TỐI THỨ TƯ HẰNG TUẦN", printed the second line's marks into the first (the acute of TỐI touched the line above, the stack on HẰ fused under the B of BAN). When the whole label prints in the kit face, the spacing is now set from the two lines' own ink: the lowest ink of the first line, plus the highest of the second, plus a small gap, never less than before, and the text is fitted with that spacing, so it gets a little smaller rather than overlapping. A label in the old font, and a kit label whose marks are compact, keep exactly the spacing they had. The capital letter on the monogram badge and a custom label's line are now centred on their capitals, not on the middle of the line box, which had put Galindo's high and would have put Paytone One's low.

**Londrina Solid ships whole too.** The label face for pills, chips and the TEST band, Londrina Solid, also reserves its name in its licence, and the kit's web copies of it were Latin subsets. They are now the whole, unmodified font (a lossless WOFF2 beside the original TTF, the same way Paytone One ships), so the dashboard, the phone page and the Windows window draw it from a file that may carry the name. Latin text looks exactly the same; the printer's labels were already drawn from the whole TTF and do not change.

**Never at the cost of a label.** Nothing about the fail-open promise moved. With the fonts missing or the kit gone, the label is the same picture as before, byte for byte (the two fail-open baselines are unchanged), and a damaged Paytone One is refused at startup and reported on `/health` and the dashboard like any other kit font. The new spacing applies only to text that prints in the kit face.

**The operator's screens.** The dashboard, the phone page, the bookmarklet page and the Windows status window load the kit's stylesheet, so their headlines, big numbers and the PRINTER chip are Paytone One now, and each page's own fallback stack names it (nothing served still names Galindo). The chip measures itself in the new face, so it is sized to Paytone One's letters.

**For maintainers.**
- `print-server/public/brand/` is re-mirrored from the canonical kit (`node scripts/gen-brand-manifest.cjs --from <canonical>`); `scripts/brand-kit.sha256` is regenerated. `fonts/` gains `PaytoneOne-Regular.ttf`, `paytone-one-full-400-normal.woff2` and `OFL-PaytoneOne.txt`, and loses the three Galindo files.
- `brand.js` registers `Paytone One` from `PaytoneOne-Regular.ttf`. `server.js` `LABEL_VOICES` maps the name, monogram and custom voices to it. New in the label type: `inkReach()` (an ink's reach above and below its line, from a 'top' or the alphabetic baseline) and `capCentre()`; new constants `NAME_LIFT_BRAND`, `NAME_LINE_H_BRAND`, `NAME_INK_TOP` (how near the top edge a name's ink may rise, 4 pt), `NAME_ROOM_SHRINK_MAX` (the most a name gives up under its floor for a mark's or comma's room, 4 pt) and `CUSTOM_TEXT_INK_GAP`; new `customLineH()` (the wrapped custom label's line pitch, from the ink), and `fitCustomLabelText()` now also returns that pitch as `lineH`.
- Tests that assumed Galindo lacked Ș, Ț and Vietnamese were moved to letters Paytone One really lacks (Cyrillic, Greek): the coverage and word-splitting cases in `test-brand-kit.cjs`, the golden cases `name-outside-paytone` and `custom-outside-paytone`, the wrapped custom-label cases, and the clip case. Each still proves what it proved, and the letters it used to lean on now have positive cases (`name-vietnamese`, `name-romanian`, `custom-vietnamese`, and two wrapped labels drawn whole in the kit). The wrapped Cyrillic and Greek labels were re-measured with only DejaVu Sans installed (the CI runner's stack) so each half stays under 91% of the line there, and each whole is over 116% of it in the narrowest face.
- `test-brand-kit.cjs` now also fails if the shout family named in `brand.js`, the kit's tokens and `fonts.css` disagree, and `test-dashboard-chrome.cjs` fails if any operator page or the chip script still names the dropped font. The golden suite gains checks, on the image itself: no first name's ink crosses the badge's top edge or the last name (eighteen names, including the accent and comma stress cases); on a crowded label the ink stays 3.5 pt or more off the paper's top edge and a diacritic costs the size it should; two wrapped Vietnamese custom-label lines share no ink and keep 2 px of clear paper (four texts that collided, 15, 5, 4 and 12 pixels, are pinned); and on the busiest step-up label the callout stays where an ordinary name leaves it and shares no ink with the trophy chip (each ink rasterised alone, so it is the same on every host).
- Golden baselines regenerated on purpose after looking at every changed label beside its old one: 46 changed (the first name's face and spacing), 2 removed (the two cases named for Galindo) and 9 added. `scripts/render-smoke-out/*.png` regenerated.
- The public website's lobby-TV mock now sets its headline in Paytone One (and loads it from Google Fonts in place of Galindo), and the README's font list is updated, so the page still describes what the displays show.

## [6.17.0] - 2026-09-28
The labels, the dashboard, the phone page and the Windows window wear the Awana 2026-27 catalog, the printer's half of the rebrand the lobby screens, the projector and the Journey kiosk shipped alongside.

### Labels wear the Awana 2026-27 catalog (labels half of the rebrand)

**What changed on the label**
- The label is set in the catalog's fonts, which now ship inside the app, so every PC prints the same label. They used to be whichever Windows font each club mapped to (Comic Sans for Puggles and Cubbies, Georgia for Trek, and so on). The first name is in **Galindo**. The last name and the small lines (handbook group, "Go to", milestone, footer, birthday age) are in **Figtree**. The club line, the VISITOR/LEADER pill, the trophy chip, the step-up callout and the TEST band are in **Londrina Solid**. Custom labels and leader name tags use the same fonts.
- When TwoTimTwo's club image can't be fetched (or is unusable), the icon column prints the club's **official one-colour mark** (Puggles, Cubbies, Sparks, T&T, Trek, Journey), converted for the thermal printer the same way a downloaded logo is, and printed white on first-timer and award labels. The letter-in-a-circle badge only appears if the mark itself is missing. As before, the club name line prints only when no logo or mark does.
- The icon column's edge is now the catalog's gentle wave instead of a straight rule.
- **The seasonal motif (the pencil and the rest) and the weekly collectible icon are gone from the label**, along with their tests and golden images. Shares, streak and the new-kid sparkle stay. The allergy, no-photo and birthday icons are unchanged. So are the label's layout rules: name fitting, fail-open templates and the safety icons.

**Settings**
- "Season theme" is now **"Screen season"** on the dashboard. It still tells the lobby welcome screens which seasonal skin to wear, and "Off" now means each screen uses its own skin. The saved setting and what the screens receive are unchanged.
- The "Collectible icon of the week" checkbox is gone. An older saved setting is simply ignored.

**Never at the cost of a label**
- Every new piece fails open. Suppose a font is missing, damaged, or lacks a letter in a child's name (Galindo has no Vietnamese, for example). That text prints in the Windows font it used before, and a name is never printed with a hole in it. A font file that is cut short or corrupted (an interrupted update) is refused at startup and counted as failed, instead of registering and printing every name blank. The face changes only between words: a name, a custom label or a word the kit font cannot fully draw prints whole in the old font, never with one letter in another typeface. A missing or broken club mark falls back to the letter badge. With the whole kit gone, the label is the one this app printed before the rebrand, apart from the wave edge.
- `/health` now lists which label fonts (`fonts`) and club marks (`clubMarks`) loaded. If anything failed, it shows a clear warning on the dashboard ("Label fonts did not load…", "Official club marks did not load…"). The Windows installer's release check now fails if the installed app didn't load them.

**For maintainers**
- `print-server/public/brand/` is a byte-identical copy of the canonical kit (Awana-Check-in-Display `shared/brand/`), pinned by `scripts/brand-kit.sha256`. To take a new kit, run `node scripts/gen-brand-manifest.cjs --from <canonical>`. The kit's text files are LF only: the script and the test refuse a CRLF copy (Git for Windows' default checkout), and `.gitattributes` keeps them LF on checkout and commit. `npm test` now includes `scripts/test-brand-kit.cjs`, which checks drift, packaging, every broken-kit case and `/health`. The golden label images were regenerated on purpose and reviewed side by side.

### The operator's screens wear it too

**The dashboard, the phone page and the Windows window wear the Awana 2026-27 catalog.** Every screen the operator touches now matches the lobby TV and the projector: an Awana-blue header with the official white Awana Clubs mark, "Club Label Printer" in Galindo, and a stepped **PRINTER / ONLINE** chip that turns **PROBLEM** when the printer is missing or jammed and **OFFLINE** when the server does not answer. Each card is named by the catalog's wavy corner tab; the big numbers are Galindo, the labels and buttons Londrina Solid, and everything you read Figtree, all from the bundled brand kit (`print-server/public/brand/`, a byte-identical mirror of the signage repo's kit), so they look the same on every PC with no network. Tonight's per-club counts are chips in each club's own colour (Puggles blue, T&T green), and each page has exactly one hot red-orange button: **Print leader tag** on the dashboard and the phone, **Open Check-in Page** in the status window, **Save & Start** in the setup wizard.

**At a glance, the top row now answers the four questions.** Prints today (with the time of the first label), children in the roster, whether names on the welcome screen are sealed (the privacy banner's verdict in two words: *Names sealed*, *Not sealed*, *Not connected*), and which printer is active with how long the server has been up. The **Season theme** setting is now called **Screen season**. The dashboard's section tabs (History, Label Preview, Settings, Diagnostics, Attendance Audit) are real buttons, so they work from the keyboard. Nothing else changed: every setting, button, count, warning and PIN rule behaves exactly as before, and a missing kit falls back to a plain, legible page rather than a broken one.

**The status window stopped claiming the server was down.** Its security policy blocked its own `/health` check, so the window always showed "Server NOT running" and a Start Server card even while labels printed normally (and Print Test Label could not reach the server either). It now allows exactly that one local address.

**Phones load the kit on the PIN screen.** The phone page is opened on the church Wi-Fi before anyone has typed a PIN, so the kit's stylesheets, fonts and SVG marks under `/brand/` are served without one. That folder holds only the public brand kit (the same files the repo and the installer ship) and no roster data; only `.css`, `.woff2`, `.ttf` and `.svg` files with plain paths are served there, nothing can climb out of it, and every other address still needs the PIN.

`npm run test:security` gains 22 checks (every asset the phone page loads comes through from the LAN with no PIN; traversal, encoded traversal, other kit files and the dashboard's chip script stay refused). New suite `npm run test:dashboard` (54 checks, in `npm test`): every colour fallback on the four surfaces equals the kit's `tokens.css`, every element the page scripts look up still exists, warnings still render their message, one hot button per surface, the phone page loads only `/brand/` assets, the Windows window ships its own copy of the kit, and the stepped chip keeps its shape. 22 suites, 0 failures.

## [6.16.0] - 2026-09-28
A lobby slide can be marked "Hold check-ins", so the banners wait for it instead of talking over it.

**A slide the room is meant to read should not be covered by a banner.** As part of the 2026-27 rebrand, the lobby displays can hold their check-in banners while a slide the operator has marked is on screen. The arrivals wait, then play at full length on the next slide, the same way the fall promo posters will. The printer's half is one optional field on a published slide, `holdCheckIns`. The display update that honours it follows this release.

**Literal `true` only, and otherwise omitted.** `buildSlidesDeck` writes `holdCheckIns: true` only when the incoming slide has exactly `true`. `false`, the string `'true'`, `1`, `null` and a missing field all leave the key out entirely; it is never written as `false`. So an unmarked deck is byte-identical on the wire to what shipped before (asserted), and a hand-edited export's `"true"` is not guessed into a mark. The publish endpoint, the persisted `lobby-slides.json`, the heartbeat rebroadcast and the dashboard's read-back all go through that one builder, so nothing else needed to learn the field.

**The chunk budget was re-measured again.** The mark costs 20 bytes a slide. The worst deck the caps admit (50 slides, 500-character text, a 60-character eyebrow, both dates and the mark) is 35,251 bytes and still needs 10 of the 12 chunks, every one sealing into the 4096 rung. The ceiling-deck case in `npm run test:contracts` now carries the mark, and also checks that deck passes the 40,000-byte publish gate.

`contract-vectors.json` (canonical here, mirrored byte-identically into Awana-Check-in-Display once this merges) gains `holdCheckIns` in the slides `entryOptionalFields`, a sentence in that section's note, a valid vector with a held slide, and a dirty vector proving `false` / `'true'` / `1` / `null` are dropped. CONTRACT.md documents the field. `envelope-vectors.json` is untouched: the framing did not change, so, like v6.12.0's dated vector, the new valid vector is picked up at the next regeneration. `npm run test:contracts` gains 18 checks and `npm run test:slides` 6 (a held slide published end to end, sealed, read back and persisted, with the non-true values absent). 21 suites, 0 failures.

## [6.14.0] - 2026-09-16
Free-text labels, and a tonight count that comes from TwoTimTwo instead of from the printer's own paper trail.

**A label that just says VOLUNTEER.** A new **Custom Label** card on the dashboard, a **Custom label** panel on the phone page, and a **Custom** checkbox beside Leader in the check-in widget all print one line of whatever you type, auto-sized and centered on an otherwise blank 4x2 label. Nothing else is on it: no wordmark, no club line, no footer, no safety icons, not even the badge outline. `POST /print-custom` reuses the leader tag's plumbing end to end (the one renderer, the duplicate window, `printImage`, the same effective-printer rules), so no new print path exists to regress.

**It records NOTHING, and that is the feature.** A custom label names nobody, so there is no history row, no attendance ledger entry, no tally change and nothing at all on the wire. The one trace it leaves is a console line. Every surface says so in small type ("Not counted, not recorded"), because a label coming out of the same printer as a check-in label had better be unambiguous about what it is not. The strongest test in the new suite renders the same text with every other renderer field set at once - a club, allergies, a birthday, a footer, the TEST band - and demands byte-identical output: nothing but the text can reach a custom label.

**Sizing starts big and only wraps as a last resort.** 56pt down to a 14pt floor on one line, and only then two lines broken at the space nearest the middle, because one big line reads across a room and two small ones do not. A 60-character string with no space in it is clipped with an ellipsis rather than bled off the die-cut edge. Control characters are stripped, internal whitespace is collapsed (a pasted newline is a space, not a ragged gap), and 60 characters is the ceiling; anything else is a 400 with a reason a human can read.

**Tonight's count now comes from TwoTimTwo's own check-in report.** The printer used to count LABELS IT PRINTED, which is not the same thing as how many children are here - a child checked in while the laptop was asleep never got a label and was never counted. The extension already fetches `/clubber/checkin_report`; when one has landed in the last 12 minutes, **that report is the count**, plus anyone who checked in since it was taken so the lobby screen still ticks up the moment a label prints. With no report (no extension running, Chrome closed, the site down) it falls back to exactly the behaviour that shipped before - and `/health` raises a warning naming the fallback, because a worse number that looks identical is the thing to avoid. The dashboard's Tonight card says which of the two it is reading. **The `tally` payload shape on the wire is unchanged**; only the numbers in it are better.

**A person's decision beats the report.** A row marked `undoneBy` - the phone's Remove, or the operator's Reset - stays removed even though TwoTimTwo goes on listing that child for the rest of the evening. `/reset-tonight` now stamps that marker, which is the fix for a real bug: the reset un-reset itself within a minute, because the next reconcile pass saw the kids still on the report and cleared every flag it had set. Reset also drops the stored report outright, so "tonight never happened" means it on every surface.

**One report the server refuses to believe.** Only a report the reconcile pass actually APPLIED becomes the count. One the mass-undo guard turned away - a partial scrape, a login bounce, the wrong table - is precisely the report that would zero a night, and the guard stays the single place that judges whether a scrape is plausible.

**Unregistered visitors do not count while a report is fresh** (the owner's call). They are not on the report and never will be, so the tick-up skips them too; a visitor who *was* registered at the desk and does appear on the report counts like anyone else. They still show on the phone's Tonight list and in the `visitors` number, both of which stay history-derived.

**Four more ways the count was wrong, fixed underneath it.** A child with both an `id:` history row and a `name:` one - a walk-in printed at the door, then the driven check-in minutes later - was counted twice; the two rows now collapse, preferring the id. `POST /reprint` **by index** could turn an award slip or a connect card into a check-in label plus an unflagged history row, counting a recognition print as a child for the rest of the night; that is now a 400, with a second guard inside `reprintRow()`. The periodic tally stopped dead at the end of the club window, freezing the wall at the 8 o'clock number while the last children were still being checked out; it now runs for an hour past the window (`church-config.json`'s window itself is untouched - recap and birthdays still use it as-is). And the duplicate-print window went from 25s to **45s**, because the extension gives up on a print at 35s and retries: a window shorter than the client's own timeout let the retry through as a fresh print, and a slow printer produced two labels and two history rows for one child.

**The walk-in row asks before it guesses.** Type a name that is already on the roster and the panel says so inline, with two buttons: **Use roster** (prints with TwoTimTwo's clubber id and the roster club, so the child is filed once instead of a name-keyed row now and an id-keyed one after the driven check-in) or **Print as visitor**. Type the name of a remembered leader and it offers **Print Leader Tag** or **Print as child anyway**. It never picks - a visiting cousin really can share a clubber's name - and it uses real buttons rather than a `confirm()`, which would block the very page the extension is driving. The extension's report poll during club drops from every 60 seconds to **every 5 minutes**, since the server treats a report as fresh for 12; the first pass still runs a minute after load, and "Sync now" is still there.

Two new suites: `npm run test:custom` (51 checks - the input rules, the wrap, "no history row, no wire frame, no count change", the duplicate window, and all three surfaces) and `npm run test:tonight` (67 checks - both count modes, the freshness boundary, the identity collapse, Remove and Reset against a report that disagrees, the visitor rule, the reprint guard, the grace window on a fake clock, and the `/health` wording). `npm run test:extension` gains 22 for the walk-in matcher, and there is one new golden baseline for the custom label. One assertion in `test-server-realtime.cjs` was updated on purpose, to pin the new visitor rule rather than the old one. 21 suites, 0 failures.

## [6.15.0] - 2026-09-18
No child was printing with the no-photo camera. The code path was verified end to end (a roster in TwoTimTwo's real 66-column shape with "N" under either release column draws the crossed-out camera), so the failure is in what the export now says, not in how the label reads it. This release makes the reader tolerant of the spellings TwoTimTwo could plausibly be using, and, more importantly, makes the dashboard show the literal values so a consent failure can never again be silent.

### The no-photo flag reads every spelling of "no"
`parseNoPhoto()` used to accept exactly `n`, `no`, `false` and `0`. It now flags any value that starts with a negative word (`No`, `Declined`, `Denied`, `Refused`, `None`, `N (9/1/26)`, `No - see mom`) and any value carrying a negative phrase (`Not signed`, `Unsigned`, `Not returned`, `Not on file`, `Opt out`, `Do not photograph`, `No photos`, `no pics`, `no media`). Blank, `?`, `N/A`, `unknown`, `pending` and the like still mean "not answered" and never flag: a camera on every unanswered child would train leaders to ignore the icon. Names that begin with N (`Nathan`, `Nora`) do not flag either; the negative word has to stand alone.

### A renamed consent column still lands on its key
`normalizeHeader()` keeps the exact-name map but adds a shape match for the two consent columns: any header containing release / consent / permission / waiver together with photo / picture / image / video / media maps to `PhotoRelease`, and with med / medical to `MedRelease`. `Photo/Video Release?`, `Photo Release (Y/N)` and `Medical Release Signed?` all resolve now, where before they fell through as unknown headers and the column vanished from every label.

### The dashboard shows what the release columns actually say
`GET /roster-status` now carries a `consent` summary: whether each column is present, a count of every distinct value in it, how many children are flagged no-photo, and which non-blank values read as neither yes nor no. The roster card on the dashboard renders it under the clubber count (values only, never names). `/health` raises a `{type:'photoRelease'}` warning when the roster has no release column at all, when nobody is flagged and an unreadable value is present, or when three or more cells and at least a quarter of the filled-in ones are unreadable. The console logs the same line on every roster load: `[csv] Photo consent: N of M flagged no-photo | Med Release? "Y" x120, "N" x3 | Photo Release? "" x123`. That line, or the roster card, is what to read the next time the camera icon goes missing.

### Tests
`scripts/test-server-helpers.cjs` pins 21 flagging spellings and 22 non-flagging ones, the renamed-header matches, the summary counts, and the warning in each of its three shapes (columns missing, nothing flagged, mostly unreadable), including that the warning never carries a name.

## [6.13.0] - 2026-09-09
The display login can hand a new screen its settings address too, not just the secrets.

**Setting up a replacement screen was three jobs.** Type the Pusher key, log in with the passphrase, then hand-configure weather location, calendar URL and corner widgets. Settings → Display login now has an optional **screen settings URL**: an https link to the display-settings JSON a screen already accepts as `?config=`. It travels inside the same sealed `provision` bundle the display key and publish token already ride, so one passphrase sets a screen up completely.

**It is NOT a secret, and the code says so out loud.** It is an address, not a credential — a public JSON file of display preferences, never children's data. It rides inside the sealed bundle only because that bundle is already going to that screen; nothing about the envelope, the pad ladder or `ENCRYPTED_EVENTS` moved. On the display it lands in **its own storage entry** and is applied through the exact remote-config path `?config=` already uses, so it never touches the settings object and therefore can never leave in a Settings export.

**https only, 200 characters, no credentials in the URL** — validated both where it is persisted (`POST /config` answers a clear 400, and the dashboard now shows the server's reason instead of a generic "saving failed") and again where it is sealed. A value that fails is coerced to the empty string; it can never turn a good frame into no frame. Plain `http` is refused because a screen served over https cannot fetch it at all, and because an unauthenticated address is the one part of this a lobby network could rewrite.

**The fail-closed rule is untouched, and is now pinned against this field.** No login, no frame. No display key, no frame — publishing a bundle with an empty key would tell every logged-in screen to drop its key, an authenticated downgrade. `npm run test:envelope` proves both again with a config URL present, that a bad URL never becomes a fatal frame, and that the URL is not readable on the wire. The frame still seals onto the same 2048-byte pad rung and stays far under Pusher's ceiling with a 200-character URL and a full publish token.

`envelope-vectors.json` was regenerated with `npm run gen:envelope-fixture` (which also mirrors it byte-identically into Awana-Check-in-Display) — the `provision` section now pins the bundle's key set including `configUrl` and states the rule in the fixture itself. The same regeneration picked up v6.12.0's dated-slide vector, so a sealed slides chunk carrying a show window is now interop-tested too. `npm run test:envelope` gains 18 checks and `npm run test:realtime` 11 (refusal and 400 for http / credentials / over-length, an accepted URL re-provisioning every screen sealed, clearing it shipping the empty string, and `/health` never carrying it to a CORS-readable caller). 19 suites, 0 failures.

## [6.12.0] - 2026-09-09
A typed slide can carry a show-until date, so last month's announcement retires itself.

**"AWANA STORE NEXT WEEK" is still on the lobby TV in November.** An operator types a dated announcement, the night happens, and nobody goes back to delete the slide. A text slide now takes an optional **show window** — `showFrom` and `showUntil`, either or both — and the deck cleans itself up on every screen at once.

**Both are bare local calendar dates, and that is the whole point.** The value that rides the wire is exactly the `YYYY-MM-DD` the operator typed: no timezone, no `toISOString()`, no conversion anywhere in `buildSlidesDeck`. Every consumer compares it against its own local date key, because in a US-Eastern evening a UTC date has already rolled over to tomorrow — which is precisely club hours. `slideDate()` accepts only a real calendar date (a leap day passes; `2026-02-29`, `2026-13-01`, `2026-9-1` and `next Wednesday` do not) and **drops** anything else rather than guessing, so a junk window means the slide always shows — never that it silently never appears.

**The chunk budget was re-measured, not assumed.** `showFrom` + `showUntil` cost 49 bytes a slide, straight out of `SLIDES_CHUNK_JSON_BUDGET`. The worst deck the entry caps admit — 50 slides, 500 characters of text, a full 60-character eyebrow *and* both dates — is 34,251 bytes and needs 10 of the 12 chunks, with every chunk still sealing into the `slides` pad ladder's 4096 rung. That deck is now a permanent case in `npm run test:contracts`, so the next optional field cannot quietly overflow the ceiling. The greedy-packing refusal is untouched: a deck the chunker cannot fit is still a 413 with nothing committed.

**Nothing about the transport moved.** `slides` stays TEXT ONLY — `buildSlidesDeck` still drops any entry carrying a `type`, so a per-device video slide can never ride the wire, dates or no dates. The deck is still sealed, still padded on its own two-rung ladder, still ordered strictly by `publishedAt`. A deck with no dates serializes byte-identically to what shipped before, which is asserted, so the field is genuinely optional for consumers.

`contract-vectors.json` (canonical here, mirrored byte-identically into Awana-Check-in-Display) gains `showFrom`/`showUntil` in `entryOptionalFields`, a valid vector carrying a window, and a dirty vector proving an impossible date is scrubbed. `npm run test:contracts` gains 11 checks and `npm run test:slides` 4 (a dated slide published end to end, sealed, with the junk date absent from the ciphertext). 19 suites, 0 failures.

## [6.11.0] - 2026-09-09
A visiting family goes into the walk-in form once: a label per child, one connect card.

**A mom with three kids at the door meant typing everything three times.** The same surname, the same club, the same guardian name and phone — while a line formed behind her. The walk-in guest section now has **"+ Add another child"** (up to four). Each row carries its own first name and club; the surname comes from the name already typed above, and the guardian details are shared by the whole family.

**Every child is still its own independent print.** The extension fires one sequential `POST /print` per child — no batch endpoint, no new route — so each label goes through the exact same single-child path, the same 25-second duplicate key, and the same history row a lone walk-in gets today. The recursion continues in the failure branch as well as the success one: **one child's failure queues only that child** and the next label still prints. The form clears the moment Print is pressed, and the status line counts the family through ("Printing 2 of 3…", then "Printed 3 of 3").

**One connect card, not four.** A new per-request `suppressConnectCard` on the `/print` body is set on every child *after the first*, so the family gets a single welcome card naming the first child's club. It is a request field, not a setting: nothing was added to the config allowlist or the Settings export. It fails toward today's behaviour in every direction — absent, `false`, or a garbage value all print the card, which is what keeps `POST /phone/visitor` (which never sends it) and every existing caller unchanged. The string `"true"` suppresses too, because an offline-queue replay is exactly the shape that would otherwise hand a family a second card an hour later.

**Two failure modes the builder refuses outright.** A blank extra row is simply not a child. And the same child typed twice — "Bea" and "bea" — is collapsed to one payload: two identical names would have been eaten by the server's own duplicate window, and one of the two children would have walked away with no label at all. Each row's identity key stays distinct (`nm:bea smith` vs `nm:cy smith`), which is the whole reason four labels come out instead of one.

**This is a typing convenience and nothing more.** There is no household index, no roster lookup, no grouping derived from registered siblings, and no auto-batching — the sibling check-in feature removed in v6.1.0 stays removed. The only "family" state is the rows a human typed, which live in the panel for one submission and are cleared on print. Leader mode hides and clears them (a leader tag is one adult), and the per-row club dropdowns join the one server-provided club list like every other dropdown, so a row added after `/clubs` answers is never stuck on the offline fallback.

**Optional TwoTimTwo registration now submits the household once.** `registerWalkInGuest` became `registerWalkInFamily`: one `Household[...]` plus `Clubber[i][...]` for each child, built from the payloads that actually printed, so a blank or duplicate row can never reach it. TwoTimTwo requires gender, grade **and** birthdate per child, so each extra row gets its own three controls and the submission is all-or-nothing — half a registered family is worse than none. Index 0 is byte-identical to what shipped before. Worth an operator spot-check on the first real family: the multi-child shape is documented (`/clubber/register` "creates a household + one or more clubbers") but has never been exercised live from here. Registration still cannot delay or undo a label — it is fired after the print chain has already started and is never awaited.

`npm run test:extension` gains 19 checks on the pure payload builder — three rows to three payloads with the shared surname, three *distinct* dedup identities, the card on child one only, per-row clubs, blank rows dropped, the four-child cap, case-insensitive duplicates collapsed, a single-token name, empty/null inputs, and wiring scans proving there is no batch route and no household index. `npm run test:connect` gains 11 over HTTP: child one gets the card, children two to four do not, all four still count as independent check-ins, and the omitted/`false`/garbage/string-`"true"`/auto-path cases each land where they should. 19 suites, 0 failures.

## [6.10.0] - 2026-09-09
The season attendance ledger is now checked against TwoTimTwo's own grid — and the holes can be filled in without deleting anything.

**Nothing had ever audited `attendance.json`.** It drives milestone lines, the streak flame, the new-kid sparkle and the auto connect card, and it is built purely from labels this machine printed. So a night the printer was down, or a night check-in happened at another station, leaves a permanent hole that quietly prints *wrong* milestones for the rest of the season — a child hits their tenth night and the label says nothing. A new **Attendance Audit** tab lists exactly which nights the two sides disagree about, per child, with one button that adds the missing ones.

**Where the second opinion comes from.** A new extension task pulls TwoTimTwo's own `/report/attendance_grid?output=csv` for **every** club — `CLUB_ID_NAMES`, not the `sharesClubIds` list the worksheet task reuses, which omits Cubbies and Journey and would have left two whole clubs silently unaudited — and posts the parsed rows to `POST /feed/attendance-grid`. It runs **off** during the club window and every six hours outside it: six CSV fetches must never compete with the print path on a Wednesday night.

**The cell encoding was never documented, so the parser refuses to guess.** Only the header is known (`"Club","Clubber","Sep02","Sep09","#","%"`). That header carries TwoTimTwo's **own** count of meetings attended, so the parser classifies each cell and then cross-checks its own tally against the `#` column **for every row** — one row disagreeing means the encoding was misread, and the whole club is discarded as unreadable rather than reported as "these children attended nothing". A missing `#` column, no recognisable date column, a login page or an HTML body are all "unknown" the same way. The date labels carry no year, so the year comes from the Aug-1 Awana season boundary the ledger already uses — not from a `from`/`to` parameter whose accepted format this repo has never verified (the fetch retries without them).

**"Not checked" is not "agrees", and it is certainly not zero.** With no grid read yet, a grid older than eight days, or a grid holding no past meeting, the card says **Not checked** and explains which — never a green checkmark, never a zero standing in for the unknown. That distinction is the whole point: a confident "your ledger is fine" built on a failed scrape is worse than no card at all.

**Apply is additive only, and that is a rule, not a default.** The ledger legitimately holds **walk-in guests TwoTimTwo never saw**, so a date only this machine knows about is information, not an error — it is listed and left alone. The button recomputes the diff server-side (never trusting a client-supplied date list), is gated on `confirm: true` like *Reset tonight*, adds only dates inside the grid's own past-meeting window, only for children who already have a ledger entry and matched exactly **one** grid row, and reports `deleted: 0` because it never deletes. Four buckets are shown and never applied: two children sharing a name (a guess here would write into the season ledger), walk-in guests, children on TwoTimTwo this machine never printed for (there is no entry to add to, and inventing one would fabricate a child's history), and clubs whose CSV could not be read. The confirm dialog says out loud that a backfill changes streaks and milestone counts — a child jumping from four nights to nine never gets their five-night line.

**Operator-local by construction.** These rows carry children's **full names**, so the route is standalone: not in `FEED_NAMES`, not routed through `makeFeedRoute()` (which publishes every registered feed to the public Pusher channel), held in memory only, rendered only on the loopback dashboard, PIN-gated for anything on the LAN, and every name escaped on output. Nothing derived from it enters `events.js`, the sealed envelope or the display contract; nothing in the audit path can print, publish, or sit in front of a label.

New suite `npm run test:audit` (`scripts/test-attendance-audit.cjs`, 58 checks, added to `npm test`): the parser lifted out of the shipped extension file — three plausible cell encodings all reading alike, a `#`-column disagreement discarding the club, the Sep→Jan season boundary, a future column counted but not reported — then the pure diff (clean match, walk-in, site-only hole, prior season out of scope, stale, no grid, unread club, twins, id-keyed entry, `Last, First`), then the routes (seven malformed bodies each 400 with the good grid intact, apply refused without confirm, apply additive with the ledger read before and after, idempotent on a second press), then wiring scans proving no publish, no print, one writer and the club-night-off cadence. `npm run test:security` gates both new routes. 19 suites, 0 failures.

## [6.9.0] - 2026-09-09
Finishing a handbook now shows up on the next label the kid prints — a trophy band the whole room can read.

**The biggest thing that happens to an Awana kid all year was nearly invisible.** Completing a whole handbook produced an award slip *if* the meeting report happened to catch it, and nothing else. So the label the child wears all evening said nothing about it. Now the next check-in label carries a bold inverse band across the bottom-left — **"Finished Sparks Wingrunner"** — so every leader and every parent who reads that badge knows.

**Where the data comes from.** A new club-night-only extension task pulls TwoTimTwo's own `/report/completed_books?output=csv` for each configured club over the last 21 days and posts the rows to a new `POST /feed/completed-books`. The server keeps them in an in-memory map with a 14-day window and looks the child up at print time. The `from_date`/`to_date` parameter formats this report accepts are **not** documented, and neither is whether its `Name` column is "First Last" or "Last, First" — so neither is trusted: the server's own 14-day window is the authoritative filter (a from_date the site ignores changes nothing), and the name key swaps around a comma so both orderings match the same child. A row whose date cannot be read is **dropped** — no band beats a band celebrating a book finished last spring.

**Printing is never gated on this, by construction.** The lookup is a synchronous in-memory map read inside its own try/catch: no await, no network, no disk beyond the history the connect-card path already reads. No feed at all — nobody has a TwoTimTwo tab open, the server just restarted, it is Tuesday — and the stock label prints instantly, exactly as before. `trophyBand: false` in Settings turns the whole thing off.

**It is never published, and that is deliberate.** These rows carry children's **full names**, so the route is standalone: not in `FEED_NAMES`, not routed through `makeFeedRoute()` (which publishes every registered feed to the public Pusher channel), same never-published class as `/feed/checkin-report` and `/feed/unverified-checkins`. It is PIN-gated like the roster, held in memory, never written to disk in raw form. The extension's own header rule was corrected in the same change rather than left quietly false: two posts (`/print-award` and this one) do carry a full name — to localhost only, for a purpose that never reaches the channel.

**Once per child per night, and never an award slip.** The band reuses the auto connect card's history gate (`loadHistory()` + today's local day + id-first identity match), so a lost label, a roster fix or a second station does not hand the same child a second celebration; a **failed** print writes no marker, because a jammed label was never seen and must band again on the reprint. This is the check-in label only — the award-slip path is untouched, and a banded label is still an ordinary check-in row in every count.

**The band takes the footer's slot rather than adding a fourth line.** The bottom-left stack tops out at three lines before it crowds the name block, and the operator footer is branding while the band is the news, so a banded label suppresses the footer. It draws with the visitor pill's inverse pair, so it reads on a first-timer's black label as well as a white one, and it is truncated against where the bottom-right icon row actually starts — the allergy icons, no-photo camera and birthday cake keep their positions, because those are safety content and this is not. An over-long or control-laden book title clips at 48 characters; a non-string one prints nothing at all rather than "Finished [object Object]".

`npm run test:golden` gains two baselines — the band alone, and the band stacked over a routing line and a milestone with a footer configured, which is the case that proves the footer yields and the stack stays at three lines. `npm run test:server` gains 33 checks on the pure band text and the feed window: the 48-char clip, every malformed title, comma-swapped name keying, both date formats plus the unreadable and future ones, over-cap truncation, per-club merge, newer-date-wins, the read-time window re-check, and wiring scans proving the feed reaches no publish call and the lookup never awaits. `npm run test:connect` gains 9 end to end (no feed → stock label, feed → marker, no second band, no award slip, kill switch), and `npm run test:security` gates the new name-bearing route. 18 suites, 0 failures.

## [6.8.0] - 2026-09-09
The phone can now show a club's roster minus tonight — who has *not* walked in yet.

**At 6:20 a leader wants the other list.** The Check-in tab greys out whoever is already in, so "who is still missing" meant eyeballing a roster and mentally subtracting while the room filled up. A third tab, **Not here**, does the subtraction: everyone on the roster who has no label printed tonight, grouped by club with a per-club count in a collapsible header and sorted by name, so a leader can call the two families who are late instead of scrolling past the forty who arrived.

**No new route, no new polling.** It re-renders the same `POST /phone/roster` payload the page already fetches every 12 seconds, and it is driven from inside `render()` rather than only off the poll — a check-in made on this phone must drop the kid out of the missing list immediately, not up to twelve seconds later. The tab count is kept current even while the tab is hidden; the DOM work only happens when it is on screen.

**A former clubber must never read as "call this family".** `loadClubbers()` returns every row the CSV ever carried, so a child who left the program would have sat in a missing list forever. `POST /phone/roster` now carries one additive boolean, `inactive`, read off the roster's own `Inactive` column with the same idiom `twinDisambiguation()` already uses, and the tab filters those rows out. The payload is still first + last name, club and three flags — no allergies, no birthdate, no notes, no photos — and it still only reaches a PIN-gated phone. Nothing here is published: no Pusher event, no sanitizer, no contract change.

**Unknown is not zero, and this is the whole discipline of the feature.** Copying the Tonight tab's `'(' + n + ')'` badge verbatim would have printed **(0)** before any roster loaded — a confident "nobody is missing" produced by knowing nothing. So the badge stays *blank* until a `/phone/roster` call has actually succeeded, an unloaded roster reads **"Roster not loaded"**, an empty one reads **"No roster — sync the CSV on the door laptop"**, and only a genuinely full house says "Everyone on the roster is checked in." A failed poll keeps the last-known-good list rather than blanking it (a network hiccup is not an empty room), and a 403 that invalidates the PIN clears the flag and the collapse state so the next volunteer never inherits the previous PIN's missing list. Same rule the lobby screens' checkout board follows: "I have no data" and "everyone is here" are opposite facts.

**Wording never claims presence.** The rows say *not checked in yet*, never "still missing" or "not in the building" — the tab knows who has had a label printed, so a nickname mismatch or a check-in done outside this server reads as missing, and the view says that out loud. A kid removed from tonight's count on a phone shows up as waiting (the server has genuinely stopped counting them) but wears that reason on the row. The rows are read-only on purpose: the Check-in tab stays the one place a check-in is driven.

**Three tabs do not fit a 360px phone**, so the label is the short "Not here" and the page got its first media query — placed after the base `.tab` rule, or it would lose the cascade — the same clipped-off-the-edge failure a sibling repo hit with a caption button.

`npm run test:realtime` gains 7 checks: the roster row pinned as an exact five-key whitelist (a dropped flag would turn this tab into a confident lie), `checkedIn`/`inactive` as real booleans on every row, a new inactive fixture row proving a former clubber is flagged rather than listed as missing, and the waiting SET itself — empty with everyone in, exactly one name after a `/phone/undo`, empty again after the Add back. 18 suites, 0 failures.

## [6.7.0] - 2026-09-09
Reprint a whole stretch of tonight after a jam, instead of one row at a time while a line forms at the door.

**A jam or a torn roll eats eight labels in a rush.** Print History could only reprint one row per click, each behind its own confirm — so the recovery took longer than the outage. The History tab now has **From / To times, an optional club, and a "Reprint this stretch" button**.

**Two steps, and the number comes from the server.** The first press is a **dry run**: nothing prints, and the strip names exactly who would come back out ("6 labels will reprint: Vega Comet (Sparks), …"). Only then does a *Print 6 labels* button appear. That is the confirm sheet — a count the page invented would be worth nothing.

**A reprint is never a check-in, and this had to stay true for a burst of twenty.** The range reuses the existing single-row path (`POST /reprint`'s body, factored out unchanged into `reprintRow()`) rather than growing a second one, so the season attendance ledger, the tally on every lobby screen and the sealed `checkin` stream are untouched by construction. The replay-night suite proves it end to end: after a six-label range reprint, the checkin event count, the tally frame count, tonight's checked-in number and `attendance.json` are all byte-for-byte where they were.

**What it deliberately refuses to print.** Award slips, connect cards and leader name tags are excluded **unconditionally** — there is no "include awards" option, because `/reprint` branches only on `isLeader` and an award routed through the kid path would record a row *without* its `isAward` flag, at which point tonight's tally counts a recognition slip as a child. A kid reconciled away by TwoTimTwo's own report or removed on the phone is skipped too: that child is not here. Failed rows are skipped. A child who already appears twice in the window (an original plus an earlier reprint) gets **one** label, keyed the same id-first way everything else is, so twins sharing a first name still get two. An unrecognised club name is an error rather than a silent "print the whole night".

**Capped at 20, paced at 400ms, and it stops at the first jam.** `printImage` is a blocking `execSync` — up to ~31 seconds of stalled event loop per label with its retry — so forty labels could starve a real check-in at the door for minutes; the gap between labels is an *awaited* timer, never a synchronous wait, precisely so a queued `POST /print` gets served in between. The musical printer is silenced for a burst (twenty tunes, each failure costing another synchronous wait). A failure stops the run and names where it stopped, instead of firing nineteen more print-failure events at a printer everyone already knows is jammed — and the response is still a 200, so a partial run reads as "printed 4, then failed on Vega" rather than a bare "failed". Rehearsal mode refuses the whole thing: a range reprint is inherently a real-night action.

`npm run test:server` gains 26 checks on the pure selector — inclusive window ends, another local day, all four exclusions with their skip breakdown, newest-row-per-child dedupe, twins staying two, `T&T`/`TnT`/`t & t` folding through `clubKey()`, reversed and malformed windows, the cap — plus wiring scans proving both routes share `reprintRow()` and that the range touches neither `recordAttendance` nor `publishTally` nor `events.publish`. `npm run test:replay` gains 19, replaying a real range reprint over the whole synthetic night. 18 suites, 0 failures.

## [6.6.0] - 2026-09-09
A jam used to look perfectly healthy from the dashboard. Now it reads red, and there is a button to clear it.

**The printer check only ever asked whether the printer still exists.** `Get-Printer` says the configured name is there; it says nothing about whether anything is coming out of it. So a paper-out, a jam or a torn roll left the dashboard green while jobs piled up in the Windows spooler behind it — and everyone at the desk believed the labels had printed. That is the worst shape a failure can take on a Wednesday night.

**The queue is now read as well.** `checkPrinterWarnings()` follows its existing 60-second cache with a `Get-PrintJob` probe and warns when **three or more jobs are waiting**, when the **oldest is past 90 seconds**, or when any job carries an error spooler status (`PaperOut`, `Offline`, `Paused`, `Error`, `Blocked`, `User Intervention`) — that last one matters because a paper-out can sit on a *single fresh* job, which is precisely the case that used to look fine. The warning names the real numbers ("4 print jobs are waiting on "Brother QL-820NWB" (oldest 3m 12s, status: PaperOut)"), and a backlog turns the traffic light **red**, not a mild yellow: in a jam and with the printer unplugged, nothing is coming out either way.

**"I could not read the queue" never arrives as a zero.** A zero is a real count — nobody has printed yet — so it must only ever mean that. The probe returns null on every failure (PowerShell missing, timeout, module absent, garbled JSON, non-zero exit, even empty stdout, which is what `Get-PrintJob | ConvertTo-Json` really emits for an empty queue), and the verdict maps any non-array to `unknown: true, count: null` with its own `spoolerCheckFailed` warning that says so in words. Same discipline as 6.4.0's reconcile work.

**Clear print queue**, on the Diagnostics tab behind a confirm. `Remove-PrintJob` has no whole-printer or wildcard form at all — `-ID` is mandatory — so the queue is enumerated and each job removed individually, with a per-job try/catch: a job that finishes mid-clear, or one belonging to another Windows user, comes back as an honest "could not be removed" count rather than an exception. The route is gated on trusted origin like *Play test tune* and *Rehearsal*, **not** merely the phone PIN — a volunteer's phone on the venue Wi-Fi must not be able to bin labels that are about to print — and it zeroes the health cache so the next poll tells the truth instead of a 60-second-stale backlog.

**Printing is still never gated on any of this.** `checkPrinterWarnings()` has exactly one caller, `GET /health`; the probe is never on the print path, never runs automatically outside that poll, and carries its own script, temp file and timeout (4s, deliberately half the printer probe's, since `/health` is awaited on a single-threaded server). The printer name reaches PowerShell the way `printPdf` does — validated by `isSafePrinterName` **and** passed as an environment variable read back with `$env:`, never interpolated. The queue projection carries **id, status and submitted time only**: a spool job's document title or the operator's Windows username would leak through `/health`, which is CORS-readable from the check-in site.

`npm run test:server` gains 45 checks on the pure verdict — empty vs unknown, both threshold boundaries, flags-string splitting, unparseable timestamps still tripping the count rule, a future-dated job clamping to age 0 rather than negative, the message's every clause, the clear-result parser refusing `removed: "4"` and `removed: -1`, and wiring scans proving the probe has no path to `/print` and that the dashboard does not swallow the dynamic message. `npm run test:security` gains 5: refused from the LAN even with a valid PIN, refused from a foreign origin on loopback, 400 on an unsafe printer name and on a missing `confirm`, and 501 off Windows so nothing shells out. 18 suites, 0 failures.

## [6.5.0] - 2026-09-09
The birthday cake on a label now says the age out loud.

**"Turning 7 this week!" beside the cake.** The cake icon told a leader *something* was going on and nothing more, so a birthday kid got noticed rather than greeted. The birth year has been on the roster all along, so the label now prints the age they turn this week in a short line to the right of the cake — every leader who reads the badge greets the exact age, and a silent icon becomes a conversation on club night.

**Real birthday weeks only, deliberately.** A June–August kid's cake is their *half*-birthday (6.0.0's `isCakeWeek`), and "turning 7 in six months" is not a fact anyone wants on a badge — so a half-birthday week prints the cake alone, exactly as before. The age is computed from the same matched year the cake keys on (`birthdayWeekYear`, factored out of `isWeekOfMonthDay` with byte-identical behaviour), so the icon and the words cannot disagree in the Dec→Jan wrap week.

**A malformed birth year prints the plain cake, never "Turning NaN".** The age is clamped the way `awanaShares` and the streak count already are: an unparseable, blank or "N/A" birthdate, a missing roster record, a future year, and anything outside 1–21 all degrade to null — and a null renders byte-for-byte the label that printed yesterday. An age is also never a standalone line: without a cake it prints nothing at all.

**All five label-render sites derive it**, so a preview, a reprint, an award slip and the Print-Dialog label say the same thing the label that first printed said — a reprint silently losing the line was the likelier bug than never adding it. On a crowded row (five allergies, coin, flame, sparkle, camera) the *words* yield first to a short "Turning 7!" and then to nothing; the cake and every safety icon keep their positions, because those are safety content and the sentence is not.

**Nothing derived from the birth year leaves the print server.** Only the integer age reaches the canvas renderer: `print-server/events.js` is untouched, so no birth-year-derived field enters the sealed `checkin` contract, the history rows, or `/health`. A test asserts that by name.

New golden baseline `birthday-age.png` plus font-independent checks that eleven malformed values each render byte-identically to the plain cake, that an age without a cake renders nothing, and that a crowded icon row is never pushed further left than the allergy glyphs already put it; `npm run test:server` gains the helper's null contract, the 1–21 boundary, the half-birthday rule, and a wiring scan pinning all five call sites. 18 suites, 0 failures.

## [6.4.0] - 2026-09-06
Does the number of clubbers checked in actually match TwoTimTwo? Now the answer is on screen instead of in a report nobody reads until Friday.

**Two counts, finally compared.** The print server counts labels it printed. TwoTimTwo counts children its own check-in screen recorded. Those are independent measurements of the same night, and nothing had ever compared them — so the case that matters most was completely silent: a child checked in at the desk, no label came out, and they walked into club wearing nothing. The extension already fetched `/clubber/checkin_report` every ~60 s for undo detection, so it now posts that report's per-club counts to the print server as well (`POST /feed/source-count`), and `GET`/`POST /reconcile` reports the verdict on the **Club Print widget**, the **dashboard's Tonight card** and the **phone Tonight tab**: `✓ Matches TwoTimTwo (101)`, or `⚠ TwoTimTwo 101 · printed 99 — 2 with no label (Sparks −2)`.

**The two directions are worded differently on purpose.** Short means a child is in the building without a label — act now. Over is usually a walk-in guest printed without *Also register in TwoTimTwo*, which is a supported way to work, so the server counts tonight's rows that carry no `clubberId` and subtracts them before calling anything wrong. A **shortfall is never** softened that way, no matter how many walk-ins there were. Club names arriving from two sources (`T&T`, `T&amp;T `, `Cubbies `) fold through the same `clubKey()` the labels use, so a club can never be double-counted under two spellings, and an unrecognised club keeps its own row rather than merging into a known one.

**"I could not read it" never arrives as a zero.** A zero is a real count — nobody has checked in yet — so it must only ever mean that. The report parser returns null when it cannot confidently understand the page, `/feed/source-count` refuses a body it cannot read, and a second opinion older than 5 minutes or belonging to another date reports *unknown* rather than agreement.

**Two report-parsing bugs found while pinning this against the live page.** The club crest sits in its own `<thead>` row *ahead* of the column headers, so the code that read "the first `thead` row" was reading the crest and never the headers — `friendsBrought` has therefore been reporting 0 all season. Every header row is now searched. And the fallback count (used when the totals row is missing) only ever produced a document-wide total; it now counts per club, from the edit link *and* the undo control, deduped so the two controls in one row cannot count a child twice.

New suite `npm run test:reconcile` (46 checks) built on a fixture copied from the live report's real markup — single-quoted `tr class='totals'`, the crest-first `thead`, a fresh unclosed `<tbody>` per row, two controls per child. It covers both directions, walk-in accounting, club-name folding, every unreadable-page case, and the endpoints. The security suite gates `/reconcile` and `/feed/source-count` on the LAN and proves an unauthenticated caller cannot plant a second opinion that makes a real shortfall look like agreement. 18 suites, 1,643 checks, 0 failures.

## [6.3.0] - 2026-09-05
Leader name tags where the labels actually get printed, and one club list for every dropdown.

**Journey is offerable everywhere.** The check-in widget's *Walk-in Guest* club dropdown was the only club list in the app without Journey, so a Journey walk-in could only be printed under the wrong club or none at all. The root cause was five hardcoded copies of the same list across three surfaces, drifting independently — so there is now exactly one: the server serves it (`GET`/`POST /clubs`, derived from the clubs the label renderer can actually style), and the widget, the dashboard and the phone page all read it. The widget keeps one baked list as an explicit offline fallback; the two server-served pages keep none. A test asserts `CLUB_MONOGRAM` and the display names stay in step and that no page has gone back to its own `<option>` list.

**Leader tags from the check-in widget.** The *Walk-in Guest* row gained a **Leader** checkbox beside *Visitor*. Because one checkbox now changes what Print does, ticking it visibly retargets the whole row rather than leaving an identical-looking form: the button turns amber and reads *Print Leader Tag*, the section heading becomes *Leader Name Tag*, the placeholder becomes "Leader's name", and *Visitor* and *Also register in TwoTimTwo* grey out — both meaningless for an adult. A leader tag remains emphatically not a check-in: it never enters the station's session dedup set, never registers anyone in TwoTimTwo, never publishes a `checkin`, and `isNonCheckinRow()` keeps it out of every count.

**Leaders are remembered, so nobody types a name twice.** Every leader tag that actually prints upserts that volunteer into a new `leaders.json`, and all three surfaces show the remembered leaders as chips: **Print** tags one, or tick several and press **Print selected** to tag a whole team at the start of a night. `POST /print-leader` now also accepts `leaders: [...]` and prints them sequentially, reporting per name — a jam halfway down a batch names the tag that did not come out instead of failing the lot. The **×** on a chip forgets a leader (a name typed wrong, someone who has moved on); anyone not printed for a club year (270 days) stops being offered but is *not* forgotten, so printing them again brings the chip straight back. Its own file on purpose: print history is capped at 200 rows and pruned at 60 days, so a leader printed three busy weeks ago would have silently fallen out of the chips. Names only — no contact details, no birthdate, no attendance — capped at 80, gitignored, and reachable only from loopback or with the phone PIN, like the roster (SECURITY.md).

A rehearsal tag still prints with the TEST band and teaches the chips nothing. New suite `npm run test:leaders` (70 checks: the club-table agreement, the store's upsert/cap/season/forget rules, a corrupt store degrading to empty, remembered-only-on-success, batch reporting, and that a batch of leader tags moves nothing about tonight); the security suite covers the three new endpoints with and without the PIN and proves a refused forget removes nobody. 17 suites, 0 failures.

## [6.2.1] - 2026-09-05
Dashboard copy for the display login (no functional change). The Display login card, its status line and its Save/Generate messages named a menu ("Display Settings → Log in") that exists only on the projector page; they now name both screens' routes — lobby TV: Settings → Connection → *Display login*; projector: Display Settings → *Log in* — matching the display app. The card and the rotate-passphrase confirm also said that changing the passphrase logs every screen out, which is not what the screens do: each keeps working with the keys it already holds, shows "log in again" in its settings, and needs the new passphrase before it can follow the *next* key rotation. docs/SETUP.md says the same. Tests unchanged (copy only).

## [6.2.0] - 2026-09-03
Three operator requests in one release: a **display login** so screens are set up with one passphrase, **leader name tags**, and a phone-page **Tonight** tab that shows exactly who is being counted and lets a volunteer fix it.

**Display login (one passphrase for every screen).** Settings → *Display login* → **Generate** saves a church passphrase (`xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx`, 80 bits; or type any 12+ character sentence). The server derives a wrapping key from it with PBKDF2-SHA256 (600k iterations, a random salt minted whenever the passphrase changes) and publishes the display key + the slide-publish token sealed under that key — the same AES-256-GCM envelope as every other sealed event — as a `provision` frame on a Pusher **cache channel** (`cache-awana-channel-provision`), so a screen that has just been switched on receives it immediately. Published at startup, on every config save (a rotated key or token reaches logged-in screens within seconds) and every 5 minutes (Pusher caches a frame ~30 min, so a screen can only *log in* while the server is running). Fails closed: nothing is published unless both a passphrase and a display key exist. `displayLoginPassphrase` joins the secret set (never readable or settable from the LAN; mintable only from the dashboard); `/health` shows only the wrapping key's kid and the last publish time. The interop fixture (`envelope-vectors.json`) gains a `provision` section pinning the KDF, mirrored into the display repo. **Requires the matching display-app release** for the screen half (Log in / Log out in Display Settings, keys under *Advanced*); older screens ignore the new channel. Threat model in SECURITY.md: the frame is public ciphertext, the passphrase's strength is the only protection, a leaked passphrase means rotating passphrase + key + token.

**Leader name tags.** Phone page → **Leader tag** (top right) and a dashboard *Leader Name Tag* card: name, optional club, Print. The label carries a `LEADER` pill, "<Club> Leader" and the club monogram — same renderer, same printer. A leader tag is a print, never a check-in: its history row is flagged `isLeader`, which `isNonCheckinRow()` excludes everywhere children are counted (tonight's stats and the lobby `tally`, the `checkin` event and recap buffer, the season ledger, the checkout board's printed count, the TwoTimTwo write-back CSV, undo reconciliation and its mass-undo guard, /reset-tonight, the phone roster) — the extension widget's Tonight count follows. Reprint keeps a leader row a leader. Rehearsal prints it with the TEST band and records nothing. New `POST /print-leader` (PIN-gated on the LAN like every other route). Two golden baselines.

**Phone page: Tonight tab.** Shows exactly who this server is counting tonight — the same deduped set the lobby-screen tally is built from — with per-club chips. **Remove** marks the child undone in print history (rows are never deleted; `undoneBy: 'phone'`), takes tonight out of their attendance ledger and rebroadcasts the tally within a second. It is **local only** (the confirm sheet says so; undo on TwoTimTwo too if the kid really left), and the minute-ly reconcile against TwoTimTwo's check-in report no longer clears a person's undo when the kid is still listed there — previously it would have re-counted them within 60 s. **Add back** (and Undo on the toast) reverses a mistaken Remove; a reconcile-detected undo cannot be overridden from a phone. **Print a visitor label** for someone not on the roster prints a first-timer label at the door and counts them, without touching TwoTimTwo; a roster name is refused (409) so the door laptop records the real check-in. New `POST /phone/tonight`, `/phone/undo`, `/phone/restore`, `/phone/visitor`. `computeTonightStats`, `/phone/roster` and the new list share one `tonightCheckins()` helper (so `/phone/roster` also adopts newest-row-wins and stops greying a kid out for an award slip of the same name). `POST /print`'s body is extracted into `performCheckinPrint()` with no behaviour change. Known limitation (pre-existing, same as R-1): the station's session dedup is not un-marked by any undo, which is what Add back is for.

Tests: 16/16 suites, ~1,500 checks — new envelope (provision KDF/round-trip/fail-closed), realtime (login lifecycle, leader phase, phone Tonight phase), security (every new route with/without PIN; passphrase redaction), helpers (`tonightCheckins`, manual undo/restore, reconcile respects `undoneBy` and ignores leader rows), demo, connect-card, replay fixture step, golden.

Removed the "sibling check-in" feature (operator request). The "Also here tonight?" panel that offered a checked-in child's siblings for a one-tap batch check-in — plus the already-disabled Quick Mode auto-batch variant behind it — is gone, along with everything that only existed to serve it:

- **Extension**: `findSiblings`, `showSiblingPanel`, `batchCheckInSiblings`, and the panel-trigger call after a local check-in.
- **Server**: `GET /siblings`, `POST /update-households`, the CSV phone/contact/address/last-name family-grouping heuristic (`buildFamilyIndex`), and the authoritative household-export index (`buildHouseholdSiblingIndex`) it preferred. `households.csv` is no longer read, written, or reported on `/health` or `/roster-status`.
- **Feed bridge**: the 30-minute `/household/csv` → `/update-households` sync task in `chrome-extension/feeds.js` is gone — nothing consumes that data anymore.
- **CSV header mapping**: the now-unused `PrimaryContact` / `Guardian` / `Address` / `PrimaryPhone` / `HouseholdID` / `ActiveClubbers` aliases dropped from `HEADER_MAP`.

The retry/verify machinery those flows shared with phone check-in and Quick Mode (`pollForCheckinButton`, `verifyBatchCheckin`, the direct-POST `tryDirectCheckin` path) stays — it never was sibling-specific, just threaded a now-always-empty batch list through. The **driven check-in** kill switch (`enableDrivenCheckin`, dashboard: "Allow driven check-ins") is unchanged and still gates the phone check-in page's direct-POST path; its label no longer mentions sibling suggestions. `/household/csv` remains a documented-but-unused TwoTimTwo export (docs/TWOTIMTWO.md, Capabilities page) in case a future feature wants it.

## [6.0.0] - 2026-09-01
Version 6.0 — the slide-sync milestone. This re-versions the line at the operator's request: the 5.33.0 lobby slide sync (a new sealed, chunked wire event and a second publish surface for the whole display fleet) is the biggest protocol change since the encrypted transport itself landed, and it deserves the major number. **No functional changes since 5.33.0** — same code, same contract v5, same tests (16/16 suites green); only the version identifiers moved. Auto-update picks this up like any other release.

## [5.33.0] - 2026-09-01
Lobby slide sync (operator request: "slides created on one machine should show up on any device viewing the web page"). The displays' typed slide deck used to live in each screen's own browser storage, moved around by exporting and importing a JSON file. Now the operator publishes it ONCE and every display shows it.

**How it works**: a new sealed `slides` event on the existing Pusher channel (contract v5). The deck is free-typed church copy, so it gets the same AES-256-GCM envelope as children's names — the public channel sees ciphertext and a coarse size bucket, nothing else. Large decks split into chunks (each sealed frame stays under Pusher's 10 KB ceiling on a dedicated [2048, 4096] pad ladder that FAILS CLOSED rather than ever emitting an oversized frame); every chunk of one publish carries the same `deckRev` + `publishedAt`, and displays order strictly by `publishedAt` — so if this server ever loses `lobby-slides.json` and its revs restart at 1, the next real publish still wins everywhere. The deck rebroadcasts whole every ~5 minutes while the server runs (club night or not), so a screen that reboots at 5 pm Wednesday — or a brand-new one — converges without anyone touching it.

**Two ways to publish**:
- **Dashboard → Lobby Slides card** (primary; works in any browser): paste or upload the display app's `awana-slides.json` export and press Publish. The card shows the live rev / publish time / slide count.
- **The display app's slide editor** ("Publish to all displays"): its https origin gets a CORS/Private-Network-Access carve-out scoped to exactly `POST /api/lobby-slides` and must present a **publish token** (generate it on the card, paste it into that display's Settings). The token is a bearer credential checked in constant time, mints loopback-only like the display key, lives in config.json's secret set (never readable cross-origin), and clearing it revokes the path instantly. Worst case if it leaks: length-capped, allowlist-sanitized plain text on the lobby TVs — it opens no other endpoint.

**Video slides stay per-device by design** — their bytes live in one screen's browser storage, so the publisher strips them (and says how many it dropped) rather than broadcasting dead references. A deck that can't be broadcast — over 40 KB of slide JSON, or one greedy packing can't fit into the 12-chunk ceiling (possible well under 40 KB with non-Latin text) — is refused with a clear 413 before anything is committed, rather than silently truncated or, worse, accepted-and-never-broadcast.

Also fixed in passing: the "Clear the display key" confirm claimed the name events stop publishing entirely; what actually happens (and what `test:envelope` has always pinned) is rollout mode — plaintext publishes that keyed screens then refuse. The dialog now says so, and notes it applies to slide sync too.

New `npm run test:slides` suite (39 checks: auth matrix incl. token-cannot-open-other-routes, CORS/PNA preflights, sealed wire frames, monotonic stamps, persistence, size gate) plus slides coverage in `test:contracts` (builder/chunker) and the regenerated envelope interop fixture. Requires display app v-next for the receiving half; older displays ignore the unknown event with a console note, so deploy order between the repos doesn't matter.

## [5.32.1] - 2026-08-22
Update self-repair (operator field report: "server failed to start — Cannot find module 'parseurl'"). The released installers were fine — every release passes a fresh-install smoke test that boots the full server — but the operator's laptop took two auto-updates within a couple of hours and ended up with a half-copied `resources/print-server/node_modules`: the signature of an interrupted or interleaved in-place update.

Two defenses:
- **Installs can no longer interleave.** `performQuitAndInstall` is now re-entrant-proof: once an install is handed to NSIS, every further trigger (the push event, the 24h poll, a manual click, a second release landing mid-install) is ignored. Two installers racing over the same directory is exactly how a node_modules ends up half-copied.
- **A broken install explains and repairs itself.** When the server fails to start with `Cannot find module`, the error dialog now says what actually happened ("the last update looks interrupted") and offers **Repair now** — it downloads the latest full installer (Electron's redirect-following net client) to temp, launches it visibly, and quits so NSIS can replace the app files. Settings, roster and history live in userData and survive. A download failure falls back to the direct release URL for a manual fix.

Immediate recovery for an already-broken install: quit the app and run `Club-Label-Printer-Setup.exe` from the latest GitHub release — config is untouched.

## [5.32.0] - 2026-08-22
Tonight count: honest, and resettable (operator request).

**The bug**: the widget's "N printed" counted raw `/history/today` rows — and history is a LOG, so an undone check-in's row stays forever. Undo a kid on TwoTimTwo and the widget number never went back down. The count (and the reprint list) now includes only LIVE check-ins: undone rows, failed prints, award slips and connect cards no longer count. (The displays' tally already handled undo correctly — it re-broadcasts within seconds of the reconcile pass spotting one.)

**The Reset button**: next to the Tonight refresh arrow, a red Reset (with a confirm dialog) zeroes the night everywhere at once:
- every active check-in row today is marked `undone` on the server — history rows are never deleted;
- tonight's date comes OUT of the season attendance ledger, so a test/rehearsal night never pollutes streaks, milestones, or first-ever detection;
- the recap buffer empties (a reconnecting display must not replay celebrations for a night that was reset) and a fresh zero tally broadcasts immediately — every screen drops within seconds;
- the extension clears its own print dedup and RE-BASELINES reconcile from the live report, so kids still checked in on TwoTimTwo are quietly re-seeded (no paper explosion) while fresh check-ins print again.

New `POST /reset-tonight` requires `confirm: true`. Six new end-to-end checks pin the whole path (refusal without confirm, stats to zero, immediate zero tally on the wire, rows marked-not-deleted, ledger cleared for today).

## [5.31.0] - 2026-08-22
Musical printing, made real (operator report: "it just prints normal"). Root cause: the tune was only ever wired to the canary test print and the dashboard demo button — regular check-ins never played anything. Now, with the toggle on:

- **Every label announces itself** — check-ins, reprints, and award slips all play a tune just BEFORE the label (so the backfeed returns the media to its start and the label prints aligned). Demo/rehearsal prints included.
- **Tunes cycle per label** (was per day): arpeggio → charge → westminster → repeat, so a batch of siblings plays a little medley. A **birthday kid's label plays "Happy Birthday to You"** (the G-G-A-G-C-B opening phrase mapped onto the motor's low speeds so all six notes fit the feed cap) — and that tune is deliberately excluded from the rotation, so hearing it MEANS something.
- **Reliability & observability for the D450-class**: the raw winspool path now uses the Unicode entry points (a printer name with any non-ASCII character used to fail the ANSI OpenPrinterA silently), every failure carries the exact Win32 error code, WritePrinter verifies the byte count, and a transient spooler hiccup gets one quick retry. The last tune attempt's outcome — success or the precise error — is now on `/health` and as a 🎵 row in the dashboard's Night Status card, so "why isn't it singing" is answerable from the dashboard instead of invisible.

The hard rules stand: the tune path never touches label printing, failures are logged and swallowed, and a kid at the door gets a label even if the music never plays.

## [5.30.0] - 2026-08-22
Removed the dashed seasonal border that traced the whole label (operator request). The per-season top-center motif stays — the seasonal art is now the motif alone, and every label edge is clean. Golden baselines regenerated (42).

## [5.29.4] - 2026-08-22
Contract-canary refinement (#3), from its first real-world run: on a quiet Saturday the sweep cried "2 check(s) failing" — `YII_CSRF_TOKEN findable` and `/clubber/checkin_report parses` — and painted a DRIFT warning on the dashboard, when both are simply what a NON-CLUB DAY looks like (no meeting tables in today's report; the CSRF input not rendered outside a live meeting context). A canary that cries wolf on weekends trains the operator to ignore the one alarm that matters.

Checks are now classified hard vs SOFT:
- **Soft** (informational, never flips the sweep to FAILING): the CSRF token check (its absence only degrades direct check-in to the proven click path) and a report page that loads and parses but has zero meeting tables ("normal on a non-club day").
- **Hard** (real drift, alarms as before): missing roster selectors, `#lastCheckin` gone, a report fetch failure or login bounce, a changed CSV export header.

The widget shows "✓ passes (N off-day notes)" with the notes on hover; the dashboard's sweep row appends the note count; the `/health` drift warning and tray alert name only hard failures. New tests pin the rule both ways (soft-only miss → no warning; mixed failure → warning names only the hard check).

## [5.29.3] - 2026-08-22
Release-pipeline fix: the v5.29.2 Windows installer crashed on launch (0xC0000005 in the NSIS stub, reproduced on two clean runners), so its smoke test failed and nothing was published — no broken build reached anyone. The only packaging input that changed since the last green build (same electron 28.3.3, same electron-builder 24.13.3) was v5.28.0's `extraResources` entry shipping `changes.md` in the FILE form (`from: "../changes.md"`), a shape nothing else in this config uses. It now uses the directory + `filter` FileSet form every other entry has always used (`from: "../", filter: ["changes.md"]`), which lands the file at the same `resources/changes.md` path the what's-new panel reads. No application behavior changes.

## [5.29.2] - 2026-08-22
Quality sweep, part 2 — eight confirmed findings from the comprehensive post-wave code review (the display's five landed in its repo):

**Timezone family — "today" now always means the operator's LOCAL day.** The UTC day flips at 7pm EST / 6pm CST, the middle of a winter club night, and several "today" computations used `toISOString()`:
- `recordAttendance` split one physical night into two ledger nights past the boundary: streaks could read 0 forever for early-arriving kids, `priorNightExists` went true mid-opening-night (auto connect cards for every late first-timer — the exact mass-fire the gate exists to prevent), and a boundary-straddling reprint double-counted a night.
- `computeTonightStats` / `/history/today` / the recap-buffer reload / reconcile's today-filter / `/checkin-csv-export` / the phone roster's checked-in set all dropped or misfiled the early half of the night at the boundary. All now share `localDayISO()`/`isOnLocalDay()` (the discipline the extension's `todayIsoDate()` always had).
- `parseBirthdate` string-parsed `YYYY-MM-DD` as UTC midnight, so local getters read the PREVIOUS day: a Mar-1 twin printed "b. Feb" and 1st-of-month birthdays fell on the wrong side of the June–August half-birthday gate. Dates are now built from components in local time, with impossible dates (2/30) rejected instead of rolled.
- The collectible week rolled at Thursday 00:00 UTC — Wednesday evening in US timezones, flipping the icon MID-club-night and breaking the "reprint matches" guarantee. Weeks now roll at local Monday midnight (new tests pin it).

**Self-verify (#2) hardening:**
- One re-drive per verify pass with a 10s gap between drives: TwoTimTwo has ONE check-in modal, and retrying two kids in the same tick spawned competing poll loops that could double-submit one kid and burn the other's retry.
- Twin-safe clearing: sibling B's successful report row no longer clears sibling A's tracked failure — a bare name match only counts when no clubberId is held.
- An oversized didn't-stick list (>30, e.g. mid-night contract drift) is now truncated to the newest by both sides instead of the server 400-ing and freezing the dashboard warning at a stale list.

**Rehearsal (#19):** the 2h auto-disarm now broadcasts a tally, so displays drop the TEST watermark immediately instead of wearing it until the next club night's first interval tally.

**Auto-focus (#1):** the never-steal guard now bails for ANY focused element (buttons, links, the modal's Checkin button a keyboard operator tabbed to) — not just text fields.

## [5.29.1] - 2026-08-22
Quality sweep, part 1 (with all 29 round-3 features now shipped):

- **Removed a duplicate `parseBirthdate` definition** in server.js — two identical function declarations existed and the later one silently shadowed the first. Behavior-neutral (they were identical), but a future edit to the wrong copy would have been a no-op trap.
- **Test suites can no longer pass by crashing.** server.js registers a production `uncaughtException` handler ("Never Crash"), which also swallowed test-time crashes: the event loop drained and the suite exited 0 without ever printing a summary — found the hard way when a ReferenceError mid-suite passed. Every suite now carries an exit guard: reaching `exit` with code 0 before the suite declared itself finished forces a failure.
- **Ideas page**: a "Round 3: built" banner records the 29-idea August 2026 wave (printer v5.13.0–v5.29.0 + the display releases) so the scratchpad reflects reality.

## [5.29.0] - 2026-08-22
Version-skew banner, dashboard half (#7). The widget half has existed since the managed-extension work: when the app has already synced a newer extension to disk, the widget says "restart Chrome to load it". But that banner lives in Chrome — the one place the operator ISN'T looking when they wonder why the fix they just installed isn't behaving. Now the dashboard says it too ("widget + dashboard", operator's pick):

- Every `/selftest` and `/contract-canary` post already carries the RUNNING extension's version; the server now records it (`extensionRunning` on `/health`).
- When that running version disagrees with the version the app synced to disk, `/health` raises an `extensionSkew` warning naming both versions and the fix ("Restart Chrome").
- Freshness-gated (30 min): the extension reports every 10 minutes while a check-in page is open, so a report from before a Chrome restart — or from last week's session — can never shout at an operator whose browser is already up to date. Pure decision function `extensionSkew()` exported and unit-tested.

This closes the contract & updates batch (#3–#7) and, with it, all 29 features from the round-3 build list.

## [5.28.0] - 2026-08-22
What-changed panel (#6): the release notes are already written — this file — so the app now surfaces them instead of asking the operator to find GitHub. Two halves ("tray balloon + dashboard", operator's pick):

- **Dashboard**: a collapsed "What's new in vX.Y.Z" card (new `GET /whats-new`) shows this file's top entry, parsed by a pure `parseLatestChangeEntry()` (BOM-tolerant, stops at the next `## [` heading). changes.md now ships in the packaged app via `extraResources`, and the same `../changes.md` relative path resolves in dev (repo root) and packaged (resources/) alike. No notes available → the card hides itself.
- **Tray**: on the FIRST boot of a new version, the Electron shell raises a local system notification ("Club Label Printer updated to vX.Y.Z" + the entry's first line) through the same `setOpsAlertHandler` hook the contract canary uses. Once per version by construction (keyed on the same `last-boot-version.json` the update beacon records), and fully independent of the opt-in public beacon — this one never leaves the machine.

## [5.27.0] - 2026-08-22
Update health beacon (#5, opt-in): after an auto-update, the operator has no confirmation the new build came back cleanly until they walk to the laptop. With the new "Update health beacon" setting on (dashboard Settings, off by default), the FIRST boot of a new version publishes `ops {type: 'update-ok', version}` on the event bus — the version string and the ok implicit in the event existing at all, nothing else ("version + ok flag only", operator's pick; "Pusher ops event", operator's pick).

Mechanics that keep it honest:
- The last-booted version is recorded on EVERY boot (`last-boot-version.json`), opted in or not — so enabling the beacon later never fires a stale announcement for an update that happened weeks ago.
- A first-ever install is not an update: no previous version on record, no beacon.
- Contract: `ops` gains type `update-ok` and an optional `version` field (bare semver only — junk is dropped before publish, pinned by new valid + dirty vectors). Old displays drop unknown ops types by construction, so deploy order never matters. Vectors mirrored to the display repo in its own commit after this lands on main.

## [5.26.0] - 2026-08-22
Record-and-replay regression fixture (#4): `scripts/fixtures/replay-night.json` is one FULLY SYNTHETIC club night — every child, phone number and address invented, so it is anonymized by construction ("fully synthetic", operator's pick) and safe to live in the repo forever. `scripts/test-replay-night.cjs` replays it through a real server instance on every `npm test` ("in-repo fixture", operator's pick), pinning both halves ("event stream + CSV shape", operator's pick):

- **The CSV shape**: the verbatim 66-column `/clubber/csv` export — quoted header with the literal `?`s and the truncated `(Te...)` column, trailing empty column, a quoted comma inside Notes, and the `Clubber Count`/`FILTER` footer — must parse, sync via `POST /update-csv`, and enrich prints. If TwoTimTwo renames a column or `HEADER_MAP` drifts, CI fails instead of labels going basic on a Wednesday night.
- **The event stream**: a night's worth of prints (normal, birthday-week via a `{{BIRTHDAY}}` placeholder substituted at test time, operator-marked visitor, a twin pair sharing a first name with distinct ids, an allergy kid, a walk-in with no CSV row), the 25s duplicate window suppressing a re-print, a reconcile undo via `/feed/checkin-report`, and the aggregate truth left behind: history rows (undone kid kept, marked), tonight's stats, the final tally per club on the wire, exactly one checkin event per real print — and the privacy rule replayed (no last name or allergy text in any published payload).

The night is data, the engine is the test file: new scenarios go into the fixture, rarely the code. 51 checks.

## [5.25.0] - 2026-08-22
Contract-drift canary (#3): a full, read-only sweep of every TwoTimTwo selector and endpoint that docs/TWOTIMTWO.md documents as load-bearing — roster DOM (`.clubber`, `.name`, club icon, `recid`/`club_id` attrs, `#lastCheckin`), the check-in form contract (`#calendar_id`, CSRF token, `events[]` rows), the authoritative `/clubber/checkin_report` parse, and the `/clubber/csv` roster export header. The existing 10-minute self-test only probes the three passive selectors; this catches the rest of the surface a TwoTimTwo redesign would silently break.

Runs automatically once per calendar day, ~45s after the check-in page settles (so drift is caught the first time the page opens that day — BEFORE club night, not mid-event), plus on demand from a new "Check site" button in the widget ("auto plus button", operator's pick). Results flow to a new loopback `POST /contract-canary`: the dashboard's Night Status card gains a "Site contract sweep" row, `/health` warns while the latest sweep is failing, a fresh failure publishes the existing `ops` `selector-fail` event (no contract change), and the Electron shell now exposes a `setOpsAlertHandler` hook that surfaces drift as a system notification ("dashboard + tray", operator's pick) so the operator hears about it even with no dashboard tab open.

Deliberately read-only: the sweep never clicks, never posts a check-in, never prints.

## [5.24.0] - 2026-08-22
Rehearsal mode (#19): one dashboard button runs a fake club night across BOTH apps. While armed, EVERY print is treated as a demo — real label, diagonal TEST band, and none of the persistent side effects (no history row, no attendance ledger, no publish, no tally bump) — and every tally broadcast carries the contract's optional `rehearsal: true` flag (staged in v5.20.0), so the check-in display wears an amber "rehearsal — practice run" watermark that appears and disappears within seconds of the toggle (the server publishes a tally immediately on arm/disarm).

Safety rails, because an armed rehearsal is a loaded gun pointed at club night:
- **Auto-disarm after 2 hours.** A rehearsal armed at Tuesday training and forgotten must never turn Wednesday's real check-ins into TEST labels.
- **Never invisible.** `/health` reports the state and shouts a `{type, message}` warning while armed; the dashboard button itself flips to a red "End rehearsal (armed)" and always shows the current state.
- **Loopback-gated.** `POST /rehearsal` uses the same trusted-origin check as the config endpoints — only the dashboard on the server PC can toggle it.
- **In-memory only.** A server restart is always a clean exit from rehearsal.

Display half landed in the display repo: the watermark pill follows the tally flag live and decays the moment the flag stops arriving.

## [5.23.0] - 2026-08-22
Batch check-in self-verify report (#2), extending the v3.0.4 guarantee. v3.0.4 made every driven check-in verify itself (the kid's row must vanish) and retry — but a check-in that STILL didn't stick died in console.log, and the operator found out at pickup. Now every terminal "could not verify" is tracked, retried, and reported:

- **Tracked**: the three terminal failure points (modal never opened, verify retries exhausted, row missing from the DOM at batch time) land the kid on a "didn't stick" list keyed by identity.
- **Retried twice** (operator's pick): the inline retry budget goes from 1 to 2, and the list itself is re-driven against the authoritative `/clubber/checkin_report` — 30 seconds after a failure and again on every reconcile poll ("both", operator's pick) — with up to 2 self-verify retries per kid (direct POST first, click-and-poll fallback). A kid who shows up in the report is cleared automatically: a late-sticking check-in is a success, not a bug.
- **Widget + dashboard** (operator's pick): a new amber row in the widget lists the count with names on hover and a Verify button; the extension also posts the full list (replace semantics) to the new loopback `POST /feed/unverified-checkins`, which surfaces it as a `/health` `{type, message}` warning on the dashboard — naming each kid so a human can re-check them on the site. An emptied list clears the warning immediately, and a list older than 3h goes stale rather than shouting forever.

Names stay loopback-only (same rule as the checkin-report feed): this list is never published anywhere. Printing is untouched — the label already printed; this is purely about the SITE check-in sticking.

## [5.22.0] - 2026-08-22
Auto-focus for the widget's roster search (#1): the search box is ready to type into on page load and again about half a second after every check-in resolves (printed, queued, or dialog fallback), cleared first so a leftover query never prefixes the next kid's name. Back-to-back arrivals become type -> Enter -> type -> Enter with no mouse.

The guard that makes it safe: focus is NEVER stolen. If the cursor is in any other field — the guest register form, TwoTimTwo's own inputs, a modal — or the operator is mid-search in the box itself, nothing moves. Restoring the panel from the pill refocuses too; a minimized widget never grabs focus at all. The whole path is wrapped so a focus failure can never break printing.

## [5.21.0] - 2026-08-22
Sealed celebration flags, printer half (#9/#10): the `checkin` event gains two OPTIONAL fields — `welcomeBack` (literal `true` on a returning kid's first night of the season; first-ever kids keep the first-timer treatment instead, never both) and `milestone` (the season night-count on the nights the label's milestone line fires, 5/10/25/50). The display's welcome-back banner and milestone wall consume them next.

### Privacy math, done before the feature
Both fields ride INSIDE the sealed envelope — a name-bearing celebration never touches plaintext, and even the bare count is per-child data so it seals too. The fixed 512-byte checkin pad is untouched: the worst-case payload (40-char name and club, every flag on) measures 255 of the 508-byte budget, 253 bytes of headroom, so no `ENVELOPE_VERSION` bump, no fixture regeneration, and `npm run test:envelope`'s length-uniformity gate still proves two checkin frames are indistinguishable on the wire. Recap entries carry the flags through so a reconnecting display still knows, and entries without flags keep the exact legacy shape — deploy order between the repos never matters. `contract-vectors.json` (canonical) adds `optionalFields`, a valid vector, and a dirty vector proving junk values are dropped, never rejected.

## [5.20.0] - 2026-08-22
Unified theming, printer half (#18): every `tally` broadcast now carries the printer's current season as an optional plaintext `season` field, so the check-in display can wear the same season the labels do — pinned, calendar-computed (Easter included), or absent when seasonal art is off. A display that boots mid-night picks it up on the next tally, no handshake. The contract also gains an optional `rehearsal` flag on `tally`, pre-staged for rehearsal mode (#19) so the cross-repo contract bumps once, not twice.

### Contract discipline
`contract-vectors.json` (canonical, this repo) adds `optionalFields: ["season","rehearsal"]` to the tally spec plus valid/dirty vectors — the display repo mirrors it byte-identically before consuming the fields, per the drift-check rule. Both fields are optional forever: a no-extras `buildTally()` keeps the exact legacy shape (pinned by test), old displays drop unknown fields, and deploy order between the repos never matters. The season value is a validated lowercase slug (a `<script>` smuggled in is dropped, never rejected); `rehearsal` is literal-`true`-only. Zero PII rides either field. CONTRACT.md updated.

## [5.19.0] - 2026-08-22
The printer sings: an opt-in musical mode makes the label printer's stepper motor "play" a two-second melody with test prints — a rising arpeggio, the "Charge!" fanfare, or the Westminster chime, rotating daily — plus a "Play test tune" button in Diagnostics. Features 7–8 of the round-3 build (#11, #12).

### How a printer becomes an instrument
Stepper pitch tracks step rate, and TSPL-family printers (the club's Phomemo/Omezizy D450-class) accept per-command SPEED changes. A tune compiles to a sequence of `SPEED`+`FEED` pairs — pitch from speed, note length from feed-distance÷speed — sent as RAW bytes past the GDI driver via winspool (`StartDocPrinter` with the RAW datatype, the standard escape hatch). Every program ends in one fast `BACKFEED` of exactly the dots fed, so the media returns to its start — a final swoop note that also keeps stock use at zero. Forward feed is hard-capped at ~2 inches, speeds stay in the D450-safe 1–6 range.

### Guardrails
Off by default (`musicalPrinter`), with a labeled dashboard checkbox that warns what to do if a printer creeps instead of returning. The raw path never touches normal label printing: its own temp files, its own PowerShell script, and `playTuneIfEnabled()` swallows every failure — the chirp rides the `/canary` test print but can never fail or delay it. `POST /play-tune` is gated on the trusted loopback origin (a phone on the venue Wi-Fi has no business feeding paper), refuses unsafe printer names, and answers a raw-path failure with a clean `ok:false`, never a 500.

### Tests
The TSPL compiler is the testable artifact: per-tune assertions for SPEED/FEED alternation, exact net-zero media movement, the feed cap, the safe speed range, CRLF endings, three-way program distinctness, daily rotation, and the unknown-tune fallback. Endpoint tests cover the off-toggle 409, the foreign-origin 403, unsafe-name 400, the stubbed-printer happy path, and the swallowed-failure 200.

## [5.18.0] - 2026-08-22
Collectible of the week: every label now carries one tiny path-drawn icon from a twelve-icon series — star, rocket, crown, butterfly, kite, acorn, music note, lightning, fish, sailboat, balloon, snail — that changes each calendar week, so a season's worth of labels becomes a collection. Feature 6 of the round-3 build (#20), closing the label-delight batch.

### Mechanics
The rotation is whole-weeks-since-epoch mod twelve (UTC), so the icon is stable for the entire week — a reprint matches the original label — and the series wraps roughly three times across an Awana year. Callers resolve `currentCollectibleIndex()` (null when the new `collectibleIcons` setting is off; it's on by default, with a dashboard checkbox) and the renderer takes a first-class `collectibleIndex` with strict bounds coercion. The icon draws leftmost in the bottom-right icon row so the safety icons keep their familiar right-edge positions; the glyph row now supports path-drawn entries alongside emoji ones. Award slips are the one label kind that skips it — a recognition print stays formal. All twelve are pure stroke work at ~13pt, nothing to dither.

### Tests
Rotation units (twelve icons, valid index, same-week stability, next-week advance, twelve-week wrap); `collectible-star` and `collectible-rocket` golden baselines, proven distinct from each other and everything else by the pairwise check; existing baselines untouched (no index means byte-identical output).

## [5.17.0] - 2026-08-22
Seasonal border art: labels now wear the season — a dash-patterned badge outline in one of eight distinct rhythms plus a small top-center motif (holly, snowflake, sun, wheat, leaf, tulip, egg, pencil), all pure 1-bit-safe line work. Feature 5 of the round-3 build (#16), and the label half of the unified theming (#18) still to come.

### Auto by calendar, pinnable from the dashboard
A new `seasonTheme` setting ('auto' default, 'off', or any of the eight seasons) with a dashboard dropdown. Auto tiles the whole year with no gaps — back-to-school, fall, Thanksgiving, Christmas, winter, spring, VBS/summer — and Easter is computed properly (anonymous Gregorian computus, pinned against published dates for 2024–2026): its window, two weeks before Easter Sunday through the week after, outranks spring. Resolved by the callers (`currentLabelSeason()`) and passed in as `input.season` — the renderer stays config-free; an unknown value renders no art at all.

### Thermal discipline, learned the v3.7.x way
No color, no gray fills, nothing to dither: the border is a 1.3pt dashed stroke (eight distinct dash rhythms) and each motif is ~12pt of stroke paths. The motif draws only when the centered name block leaves real headroom — a crowded label keeps its ink for the name. The golden suite's pairwise-distinctness check is what proves all eight seasons render differently from each other and from the plain label.

### Tests
Computus pinned for three published Easters; season samples for every window including the Easter-outranks-spring boundary on both sides; a full-year sweep proving the tiling has no holes; eight new golden baselines (existing ones untouched — no season means byte-identical output).

## [5.16.0] - 2026-08-22
Twin-safe labels: when two active roster kids share the exact same first and last name, their labels now tell them apart — a middle initial on the first-name line when the roster ever carries one, else a small "b. Mar" whisper under the last name. Feature 4 of the round-3 build (#13).

### Middle initial preferred, birth month in practice
TwoTimTwo's real `/clubber/csv` export (the verbatim 66-column header pinned in `test-server-helpers.cjs` and `docs/TWOTIMTWO.md`) has **no middle-name column**, so the middle-initial path is opportunistic future-proofing — `twinDisambiguation()` checks the unmapped raw columns `parseCSV` preserves, and falls back to the birth month, which is always present in practice, meaningless to strangers, and stable across years (unlike a grade hint). Inactive roster rows never count as twins — they aren't in the building. Matching uses the same case/whitespace normalization as `findClubber`, so the twins the hint splits are exactly the twins lookup confuses.

### Rendering
Two new first-class renderer inputs: `middleInitial` rides the first-name line (inside the width fit) and `nameHint` renders as a 9pt italic whisper under the last name, participating in the block-height math and the height-fit. Both empty for a unique name, so the common label renders byte-identically — zero regenerated baselines besides the torture case (which now carries a hint, per its every-field mandate). Applied at all five render sites, award slips included — an award slip is identity-critical too.

### Tests
Six helper units (unique-name no-op, birth-month fallback, middle-initial preference, inactive-rows-don't-count, normalization, no-data no-crash) plus `twin-hint` and `twin-initial` golden baselines.

## [5.15.0] - 2026-08-22
New-kid sparkle: a kid's label carries a small ✨ in the bottom-right icon row for their first two club weeks, so leaders learn the new names fast. Feature 3 of the round-3 build (#15).

### First two weeks, first-ever night
The window is day-based — tonight within 14 days of the kid's first-ever night on the attendance ledger — which covers their first two typical weekly club nights and doesn't stretch when a make-up event lands in the same fortnight. Computed in `recordAttendance()` (the ledger is already open there for milestones, the auto connect card, and the streak) and passed to the renderer as a first-class `isNewKid` boolean. Attendance-derived, so real check-in prints only — no sparkle on previews, reprints, or demo labels. Pairs naturally with the auto connect card: night one gets the welcome card AND the sparkle; nights two gets just the sparkle.

### Tests
Ledger units pin the boundary exactly (first night 13 days ago still sparkles, 14 days ago doesn't), plus first-ever-tonight and long-timer cases; a new `new-kid-sparkle` golden baseline pins the render and the torture case now sparkles too (its baseline the only regenerated one).

## [5.14.0] - 2026-08-22
Attendance streak flame: from six consecutive club nights on, a kid's label carries a "🔥 N" badge in the bottom-right icon row — the same coin-badge pattern Store Night shares use. Feature 2 of the round-3 build (#14).

### Club nights, not calendar weeks
The streak walks the attendance ledger's union of dates — any night some kid attended is a club night — backwards from tonight, counting until the first club night this kid missed. Christmas break and cancelled weeks therefore never break a streak; only a night the club actually met and the kid stayed home does. Computed inside `recordAttendance()` (which already loads the ledger for milestones and the auto connect card) and returned alongside `seasonCount`/`firstEver`/`priorNightExists`; `/print` passes it to the renderer as a first-class `streakCount` input with the same never-print-NaN coercion as `awanaShares`. Attendance-derived, so like the milestone line it appears on real check-in prints only — never on previews, reprints, or demo labels.

### Tests
Ledger unit tests pin the unbroken-run count, the missed-night reset, and the gaps-don't-matter property; a new `streak-flame` golden baseline pins the render and the torture case now carries a streak too (its baseline regenerated — the only one).

## [5.13.0] - 2026-08-22
Half-birthday cake: kids with June–August birthdays — whose real birthday week never lands on a club night, so they watch every other kid get a 🍰 and never get one — now get the same cake on their half-birthday week, six months on, squarely inside the Awana season. First of the round-3 build picks (#8); implemented serially, one feature per release entry, with a single Windows release at the end of the batch.

### Label only, deliberately
The cake icon now keys on `isCakeWeek()` (real birthday week OR a summer kid's half-birthday week) at all five label render sites — `/print`, `/label`, `/preview`, `/reprint`, `/print-award`. Everything display-facing stays on real birthdays: `/print` splits the value so the sealed `checkin` event's `isBirthday` is unchanged, and `publishBirthdays` plus the tonight-stats birthday roster are untouched — nobody on stage wishes a January "happy birthday" to an August kid, and the dashboard's birthday list stays literally true.

### Mechanics
`isBirthdayWeek` was refactored into `parseBirthdate` + `isWeekOfMonthDay` (behavior identical — the ISO-week semantics fixed in 3.6.2/5.x are shared, not copied), and `isHalfBirthdayWeek` gates on birth month June–August then targets month+6 with the day clamped into the target month (an Aug 31 half-birthday is end-of-February, never a roll into March). New unit tests pin the gate, the clamp, the garbage-in contract, a run-any-day dynamic check, and — by source inspection, same style as the `effectiveHandbookGroup` wiring test — that exactly the five label sites take the cake while the display feeds stay real.

## [5.12.0] - 2026-08-22
Per-club label templates: the dashboard's Label Preview tab is now an editor where each club (or the default for all of them) can switch parts of the label on or off and cap the name size, with a live server-rendered preview. Third and last of the ideas-triage picks (#1).

### A constrained template, not a free canvas
A template is a small set of switches — club logo/monogram panel, last name, club-name line, handbook-group line, VISITOR pill, footer — plus a first-name size cap (18–48pt). Deliberately NOT a drag-anything designer, for two graveyard-tested reasons: the v3.7.x per-club visual themes were removed because color and pattern dither to mush on 1-bit thermal output (per-club variation survives as font + icon, and templates don't reopen that door), and every pixel of freedom is a way to break the one artifact that must never fail at the door. Safety content is not templatable at all: allergy icons, the no-photo camera, and the birthday cake always print; the step-up callout and a connect card's greeting ignore the group-line switch.

**Fail open, always.** Templates are resolved by the caller (`labelTemplateFor()`: exact club → `default` → stock) and passed into `generateLabel()` as part of its input — the renderer still never reads config, so the golden suite stays honest. Every switch defaults to on; a missing, partial, or hand-mangled template renders the stock label byte-identically. `test-label-templates.cjs` proves a config.json with arrays-for-templates garbage still prints.

### Storage and the write gate
`config.labelTemplates` stores overrides only, keyed by `clubKey()` (so `T&T`, `t & t` and `tnt` can't diverge into three templates; an unrecognized club name is served by `default`). It saves through its own `POST /config/label-templates` with a strict sanitizer — unknown fields dropped, out-of-range name caps dropped, at most 12 club entries — rather than more keys on the flat `/config` body, following the schedule endpoint's pattern. Writes are gated on `isTrustedConfigOrigin` — stricter than the other non-secret keys, deliberately: a template changes what gets printed for a whole club, and the phone PIN is a LAN-trust credential, not authorization to restyle every label. Reads are open like the rest of `/config`.

### The editor
Lives in the Label Preview tab: pick Default or a club, tick switches, drag the name-size slider, and the preview re-renders through the real `GET /preview` — which now accepts an unsaved `?template=<json>` override (sanitized identically, never persisted, malformed JSON falls back to the saved template) and `?visitor=1` so the pill switch is visible. Nothing prints differently until Save posts the whole map.

### Tests
New `test-label-templates.cjs` (20 checks, in `npm test`): sanitizer normalization and clamps, the origin gate, saved-template resolution changing real render bytes, the preview override, default-serves-unknown-clubs, and the garbage-in-config fail-open. Two new golden baselines: `template-no-icon` (full-width reflow) and `template-minimal` (everything templatable off — the name and the allergy icon survive).

## [5.11.0] - 2026-08-22
The connect card now prints itself for first-time visitors — no checkbox required — and lost its three known warts along the way. Second of the three ideas-triage picks (#10); the per-club template editor (#1) is next.

### Auto-detection: a new face at a club that has met before
There is no first-timer field anywhere in TwoTimTwo's data (`server.js` has documented that uncertainty for a while, and `docs/TWOTIMTWO.md` is silent), so the trigger is the attendance ledger — the one memory this machine already keeps. A new `connectCardAutoFirstTimer` toggle (off by default, under the existing connect-card checkbox) fires the card when **both** hold: tonight is the first date the ledger has ever seen this child (`dates[]` is never pruned, so this spans seasons), and some child attended on an earlier night. The second half is what keeps opening night — and a fresh install, where *every* kid's count is 1 — from burying the printer in welcome cards. The auto path also checks history so one kid gets at most one card per night, even across the 25s dedup window (re-print with a fresh clubberId, second station); the operator's explicit visitor flag stays unrestricted, because re-flagging after a lost card is deliberate. The roster's `New to Awana?` column was considered and passed over: it's registration-scoped (it would fire all season for the same kid), while the ledger fires exactly once — but it remains available verbatim on the row if a future refinement wants it.

The label's inverted first-timer palette deliberately stays on the explicit flag only. A heuristic misfire that prints one extra welcome card is shrugged off; one that turns a regular kid's label black tells every volunteer to welcome the wrong child. The sealed Pusher `checkin` event's `isFirstTimer` **does** carry the auto-detection (same field, same boolean type — no envelope or consumer change; CONTRACT.md updated), so the lobby screen welcomes auto-detected families too.

### The attendance ledger grew up
`recordAttendance()` now returns `{seasonCount, firstEver, priorNightExists}` instead of a bare count, and is keyed id-first with a one-time migration from the legacy name key — the same identity fix `historyIdentityKey` already made for print history, so two same-named kids stop merging the moment a caller knows who they are, and a kid's existing streak moves with them. A kid whose entry migrated and who later prints *without* an id starts a fresh name entry; the failure modes there are a wrong milestone line and a spurious welcome card, both benign, both no worse than the collision behaviour this replaces.

### The three warts
- **The greeting had a 30-character ceiling nobody intended** — it rode in the `handbookGroup` slot. `generateLabel()` now has a first-class `greeting` field that renders on the same line but is width-fitted only, and the text is operator-configurable (`connectCardGreeting`, default unchanged: "We're so glad you're here!").
- **The card was invisible** — it never reached print history. It's now recorded like an award slip: visible in the dashboard (with a CONNECT CARD badge; awards got an AWARD badge in passing), excluded from everything that counts check-ins. That exclusion now lives in one shared predicate, `isNonCheckinRow()`, used by tonight's stats, the CSV write-back into TwoTimTwo, undo reconciliation, milestones and reprint-by-name — a missed site at any of those would double-count a child, which is why it's one function and not five copies of `!e.isAward`.
- **A demo visitor's card printed unmarked** — the card now carries the same diagonal TEST band as its demo label, and is never recorded in demo mode.

### The bottom band reserves what it actually needs
The card's own golden baseline caught the greeting line sitting on top of the schedule line: the centered text block reserved a flat 20pt for the bottom band, enough for the icon row or ONE text line, and the card stacks two (schedule + footer). The reservation now scales with the actual bottom-left line count (goTo/milestone/footer), and when a crowded label's text block would overflow the space that leaves, the FIRST NAME shrinks to fit (blockH is linear in its size, floor 18pt — same floor as the width fit) instead of descending into the band. Four baselines regenerated for this (`go-to-line`, `milestone-line`, `footer-with-go-to`, `torture-all-fields`) — the first two because goTo/milestone lines previously reserved nothing at all, which was the same latent collision one config option away.

### Tests
New `test-connect-card.cjs` (32 checks, wired into `npm test`): ledger signals including the opening-night guard and the id migration, the HTTP auto-trigger end-to-end, once-per-night behaviour, the toggle, greeting sanitization, and paired negative controls proving a card row never inflates tonight's stats, the write-back CSV, or reprint-by-name. One new golden case (`connect-card`) pins the card's shape — 34-char greeting past the old cap, visitor pill, schedule line, footer.

## [5.10.0] - 2026-08-22
Labels can now carry a configurable footer — one short operator-set line (church name, a verse, service times) printed along the bottom of every label. First of the three features picked from the ideas triage (#8 on the scratchpad); the connect-card auto-trigger (#10) and per-club template editor (#1) follow.

### One line, on every label that goes home
A new `labelFooter` config key (Settings → Check-in Features → "Label footer", blank by default) renders as an italic 10pt line at the very bottom-left of the badge, below any "Go to:" routing or milestone line. It rides on every render path a family sees — check-in labels, the connect card, reprints, award slips, `/label` dialog renders, and the dashboard preview — but not canary/test labels. The value is not a secret (it's printed on paper by design), so it saves through the normal `POST /config` path; it is sanitized to a single printable line before persisting (control characters become spaces, whitespace collapses, 60-char cap) and clearing it deletes the key, the same pattern as `phonePin`.

The renderer never reads config: the handlers pass the footer in as `input.footerText` via a tiny `labelFooterText()` helper, so `generateLabel()` stays a pure function of its argument and the golden-image suite keeps meaning what it says. An empty footer renders byte-identically to 5.9.0 — confirmed by 22 of 24 baselines surviving regeneration untouched.

### The bottom band stopped guessing where the icons are
Adding a line that appears on *every* label exposed a latent collision: the bottom-left lines (goTo/milestone, now footer) truncated at a flat 55% of the badge width, while a five-allergy icon row grows leftward past that point — so the torture case interleaved text through the allergy emoji. The lines now truncate against the icon row's actual left edge (measured, not guessed), which also means an icon-less label lets the footer run nearly the full badge width instead of cutting off at half. A configured footer also reserves the same 20pt bottom strip the icon row does, so the centered name block can't descend onto it.

### Tests
Two new golden cases (`footer`, `footer-with-go-to` pinning the stack order: footer at the very bottom, routing above) and the torture case now carries a footer too — its baseline is the only regenerated one. `test-config-store.cjs` adds `labelFooter` to the server-owned keys that must survive a setup-wizard save.

## [5.9.0] - 2026-08-10
Renamed the product from "Awana Label Printer" to **"Club Label Printer"** — Awana Clubs International's published Trademark Guidelines say they don't grant permission to create products bearing their name, and this app's own branding (window titles, tray text, Start Menu/Desktop shortcuts, the installer filename, the website) was doing exactly that. A first pass the same guidelines review turned up (disclaimer wording, ® marking) shipped as website/README-only copy fixes with no version bump; this release is the actual rebrand.

### What changed, and what deliberately didn't
Every user-visible string changed: the Electron app's window titles, tray tooltip/menu, error dialogs, the installer artifact (`Club-Label-Printer-Setup.exe`), the browser-extension widget ("Club Print"), the print-server dashboard/phone/bookmarklet pages, the website (nav, hero, install guide, footer, capabilities page), and all the docs (README, TROUBLESHOOTING, EXTENSION, SETUP, NIGHT-OF, CONTRACT). The legacy `install-and-run.ps1`/`install.bat`/`launch-awana.bat` scripts (deprecated, superseded by the .exe installer) got their banners renamed too, but **not** the shortcut/firewall-rule names they create on disk (`Awana Check In.lnk`, `Awana Print Server (TCP 3456)`) — those are literal legacy artifact names `migrate.js` already keys off for cleanup, and this script is on its way out regardless.

Three things were **deliberately left alone**, because changing them is what would actually break existing installs rather than just being untidy:
- `electron-app/package.json`'s `"name"` (`awana-label-printer`) and `"appId"` (`com.kvbc.awana-label-printer`). Neither is ever shown to a user, and — confirmed the hard way in `build-electron.yml`'s CI comment — electron-builder derives the install directory *and* `app.getPath('userData')` from `"name"`, not `"productName"`. Renaming it would silently orphan every existing install's config, roster, and print history in a folder nothing points at anymore, and break the NSIS upgrade-in-place registry lookup. `productName` (`Club Label Printer`) is what actually changes the file's displayed name, Start Menu/Desktop shortcut text, and window/taskbar text — all of it, with none of the data-loss risk. `%APPDATA%\awana-label-printer\chrome-extension` is therefore still the real path today; EXTENSION.md/TROUBLESHOOTING.md/docs/SETUP.md previously all claimed the title-case `Awana Label Printer` folder, which was already wrong before this release (electron-builder never used `productName` for this) — corrected while touching these docs anyway.
- The Pusher channel `awana-channel` (`print-server/church-config.json`'s default, `CONTRACT.md`) — this is the wire-protocol identifier the separate `Awana-Check-in-Display` repo's lobby signage subscribes to. Renaming it here with no coordinated change on that side would silently stop every check-in/tally/birthday event from reaching the display.
- Internal-only identifiers with zero user visibility: the `AWANA_DATA_DIR`/`AWANA_BIND_HOST`/`AWANA_PORT` env vars, the `X-Awana-Pin` header, `window.awana` (the preload bridge), and the DOM ids/localStorage keys/`[Awana]` console-log tags throughout `chrome-extension/content.js`. None of these function as a trademark — they're plumbing nobody but a developer ever reads — and touching them buys no compliance benefit for real risk of breaking something.

### Upgrade path for existing installs
`productName` changing *does* move where NSIS puts shortcuts (electron-builder names `.lnk` files after `productName`), so an update leaves the old "Awana Label Printer.lnk" behind alongside the new "Club Label Printer.lnk" — `migrate.js`/`main.js` now detect the old-named shortcut on Desktop and in the Start Menu and offer to remove it once, same pattern already used for the legacy-script-install shortcuts. No data migration is needed at all, since userData never moves (see above).

### Not fixed here — flagged for the project owner
The label-printing feature fetches each club's official Awana logo from the operator's own TwoTimTwo account and reprocesses it (dithers/binarizes for thermal output) — core to what this app does, and not something a rename touches. This technically brushes against the guidelines' "never modify our logos" rule; the actual remedy, if the owner wants one, is a permission request to `permission@awana.org`, not a code change.

## [5.8.2] - 2026-08-03
The no-photo flag now honors an explicit "no" in EITHER release column — fixing a real consent failure at KVB, where every no-photo child was printing without the camera icon.

### An unused column was eating the media release
TwoTimTwo's clubber export carries both `Med Release?` and `Photo Release?`. The code assumed photo consent lives in the photo column and used `Med Release?` only as a fallback for exports that lacked `Photo Release?` entirely. Field data proved the assumption wrong: KVB records the **media** release under `Med Release?` and never touches `Photo Release?` — and since the unused column still exists in every export, the precedence rule read the blank photo column, found no explicit "no", and silently dropped the flag for every no-photo child. The label, the reprint, and the dashboard's no-photo list all inherited the same blindness, because they all (correctly) derive from the same helper.

`noPhotoFor()` is now an OR, not a precedence chain: an explicit "no" under either column flags the child. A consent flag must fail toward protection — the worst outcome of OR is a spurious camera icon on a child whose medical release was declined but whose photos are fine; the worst outcome of precedence was photographing a child whose family said no. Blank, missing, and unrecognized values in both columns still mean "photos allowed", so rosters without either column are unaffected. The fixture test now pins the OR (`Amy: med=n, photo=y → flagged`) and calls the real exported `noPhotoFor` instead of a private copy of the rule.

## [5.8.1] - 2026-08-02
Identical to 5.8.0 in every feature — this release exists because 5.8.0's installer never got built. GitHub's workflow parser rejects `secrets.*` inside a step-level `if:` expression, and the new "ping laptops over Pusher" step used exactly that guard; the whole workflow file was invalid, so the tag was created but its build died before it began. The inline notify script already guards itself (it exits cleanly, with a log line, when the Pusher secrets are absent), so the `if:` is gone and the script is the guard. The orphaned `v5.8.0` tag remains in the repo with no release attached; this is the real 5.8 release. See 5.8.0's entry below for what actually shipped.


## [5.8.0] - 2026-08-02
Updates now reach the laptop in seconds, not hours — and an update that arrives mid-club installs itself immediately, because a mid-club release only ever means an urgent fix is on the way.

### Releases are pushed, not polled
When a release publishes, the build workflow now pings the same Pusher channel the lobby display already listens to, with a tiny `update` event carrying nothing but the version number and a timestamp. The app subscribes to that channel (read-only, with the same key/cluster/channel it already uses to publish) and reacts to the ping by asking electron-updater to check the real GitHub release feed — the ping is a doorbell, never the package, so a spoofed event could at most trigger a harmless verified check. Displays are untouched: they bind only their known event names, and CONTRACT.md now documents `update` as laptop-internal, version-only, forever.

The push leg activates when the repo has `PUSHER_APP_ID` / `PUSHER_KEY` / `PUSHER_SECRET` / `PUSHER_CLUSTER` secrets (plus optional `PUSHER_CHANNEL`); without them the workflow step skips silently and nothing breaks. The old every-6-hours poll relaxes to every 24 hours — with push doing the real work it's just the safety net for a laptop that was off when the doorbell rang, alongside the unchanged check on every launch.

### Updates install themselves, mid-club included
The previous policy — download silently, install on quit, never restart mid-club-night — optimized for not surprising anyone. The operator has reversed it deliberately: the only reason a release ships at 7:15pm on a Wednesday is that something is wrong right now. When a download completes, the app now gives any in-flight work a few seconds of grace (it will consult a server busy-signal if one is ever exported; today it is a fixed 5-second grace), shows "Updating to vX… restarting" in the tray, then quits, installs silently, and relaunches itself — kiosk-style, nobody at the keyboard, print server back up in seconds. Install-on-quit remains as a fallback for the rare download that lands exactly as someone closes the app.

### Verification
New unit suite for the push-event logic (payload shape, identical-version debounce, different-version always acts, stale versions deferred to the updater's own feed check). The workflow's Pusher signing was exercised for real from CI-like conditions — a correctly signed request reaching Pusher and rejected only on credentials proves the wire format without spending a real secret. All 12 suites green; root build green; secrets and signatures never appear in workflow logs.


## [5.7.0] - 2026-08-02
Undos on TwoTimTwo now actually undo: the count comes back down and the kid can be checked in again. Phones refresh themselves instead of showing 7:00pm data all night. And the PIN lockout stops punishing honest thumbs.

### An undone check-in is finally noticed
The printer's tally (and everything downstream: the lobby ticker, the gym display's corner counter) recounts its own label history — and nothing ever told that history about an undo made on TwoTimTwo's check-in report. The stale count survived all night, and the phone page kept the kid greyed out as "checked in", so a volunteer couldn't fix the mistake by just checking them in again.

The extension already polls `/clubber/checkin_report` (the authoritative "who's in tonight" table) every minute for label reconciliation (R-1, since 5.2). That same pass now posts the report's identity list to the print server, which diffs it against tonight's history:

- A kid present in history but gone from the report is marked **undone** (the record is kept — history doubles as the print log — just no longer counted). The tally rebroadcasts immediately, so displays drop within seconds, not at the next minute tick.
- `/phone/roster` stops reporting an undone kid as checked in, so **phones can re-check them in**; the fresh check-in prints a label, broadcasts, and counts once — latest record wins, deterministically, even across reprints.
- If the kid reappears in the report with no new print (the undo itself was the mistake), the undone flag clears in place.

Guards, because a bad scrape must never mass-undo a club night: the extension only posts a report that parsed successfully (an empty or bounced page never masquerades as "nobody's here"); a pass that would undo more than half of tonight's kids is skipped and logged as a suspect scrape; and visitor entries are never undo-marked (the report's coverage of first-timers is unverified) though reappearance can still clear a false undo on one. No event shapes changed — the display contract is untouched; the numbers just stopped lying.

### Phone screens refresh themselves
The phone page fetched the roster exactly once, at PIN entry. Every later change — another phone's check-ins, the desk's, an undo — was invisible until someone thought to pull-to-refresh a page that had no refresh. Now it re-fetches every ~12 seconds (same family as the dashboard's 15s polls), plus immediately when the screen comes back to focus and right after its own check-in resolves. Server truth merges into the list without touching a row whose check-in this phone still has in flight — the old renderer rebuilt every button on each paint, so a naive poll would have wiped a "Working…" button mid-check-in; transient state now lives outside the DOM precisely so a refresh can never eat a check-in in progress. Offline, the poll backs off to 60s and catches up on the first success; a wrong PIN (the desk changed it) stops polling cold and returns to the PIN screen rather than grinding the limiter in the background.

### The PIN lockout counts mistakes, not anxiety
Two compounding bugs made the lockout fire far earlier than its advertised 8 attempts. The unlock button had no in-flight guard, so a double-tap (or Enter-mashing on a slow network) sent the same wrong PIN two or three times — each counted. And every wrong request counted separately even when it was literally the same guess, so four honest typos worth of mashing could lock a phone. Now: the button disables while a request is out; and server-side, repeated identical wrong guesses from the same phone count as one failure (a salted hash of the last failed guess is compared — the guess itself is never stored). Distinct guesses still count, so the brute-force math is intact — a guesser has to vary PINs, and 8 distinct failures still locks for 60 seconds. The lockout message finally shows a live countdown from the server's own Retry-After instead of "wait a minute".

### Verification
New pure-function tests for the reconcile diff (mark, clear, reappear, latest-wins across reprints, visitor exemption both directions, the exact mass-undo boundary) and limiter dedupe (identical guess ×10 counts once; distinct guesses still lock; success still clears; per-address scoping intact), plus end-to-end HTTP tests: tally decrements and republishes on undo, the roster frees the kid, and a real re-check-in through `/print` after the real 25-second duplicate window counts exactly once. Full suite green, root build clean.


## [5.6.1] - 2026-08-01
Puggles labels are fixed: the club logo now prints as solid black instead of a ghost, and the meaningless "Puggles group" line is gone.

### The Puggles logo printed as a tiny speck
Every club's icon on TwoTimTwo is a standard Awana image except Puggles — this church's Puggles image is a custom upload (`/database/customFile/315`), and it is a **light-cyan** wordmark. A thermal printer has exactly two tones; the driver dithers everything else, and light cyan dithers to (almost) nothing. The only pixels dark enough to survive were the duckling's eyes and beak — so the printed label showed a tiny unreadable speck floating in the icon zone. And because a logo was "successfully" drawn, the club-name text line was suppressed too: the label carried no readable club identity at all.

Club logos are now prepared for what the printer can actually say (`prepareLogoForThermal`):

- **Anything opaque and meaningfully non-white becomes solid black ink.** The distance-from-white test is per-channel, so light-but-saturated colors — cyan, yellow, pink — count as ink even though their gray luminance is high. Gray luminance is exactly the measure the dither uses to erase them; that gap *was* this bug.
- **White stays white**, so white-on-dark logos keep their lettering as holes, and the duck's eyes survive as white cutouts in the silhouette.
- **The logo is cropped to its ink** before scaling, so artwork marooned in a padded canvas fills the icon zone instead of shrinking with its padding. The existing too-small-source check now measures the artwork, not the canvas.
- **A logo with no printable ink at all** (all-white, near-white, transparent, undecodable) falls back to the monogram badge — and, since no logo was drawn, the club name still prints as text.

All five standard Awana club images (Sparks, Cubbies, T&T, Trek, Journey) were rendered with the real assets from TwoTimTwo and come out crisper than before — solid black wordmarks instead of dithered color. The dashboard's Label Preview shows the binarized logo too, which is a feature: the preview now shows what the printer will actually produce.

### "Puggles group" no longer prints
TwoTimTwo assigns Puggles kids a pseudo handbook group — literally the string "Puggles group" — and it printed as an italic line under every Puggles name. Puggles is the toddler program: no handbooks, no handbook time, nothing to route to. The handbook-group line exists to send a child to the right table, so values that route nowhere now print as nothing (`effectiveHandbookGroup`): the "all" placeholder (existing rule, now centralized instead of pasted at four call sites), any Puggles group, and a group named after its own club ("Sparks group" says only what the icon already says). Real groups — "Sparks A", "Flight 3:16" — are untouched, end to end.

One of the four call sites was fixed in the process: the reprint path referenced a variable that is not in scope in that handler, and the driven-print path now judges the group against the club that actually prints (after the roster fill), so a club-less POST for a Puggles kid still drops the pseudo-group.

### Found by adversarial review, fixed in the same release
An independent multi-agent review of the diff caught a real regression the first 831 assertions could not see: **on inverted labels (first-timer visitors and award slips) the icon panel prints near-black, and the newly binarized black logo vanished into it** — black on black, with the club-name text also suppressed because a logo "was drawn". Logo ink now follows the label's palette (white on inverted labels), pinned by a golden case whose invariant counts LIGHT pixels in the dark icon zone — counting dark ink there would pass trivially, which is exactly how this slipped past the other five logo checks.

Also from review: club-less requests through `POST /label` (Print Dialog mode) and `GET /preview` now fill the club from the roster before judging the group — previously only `/print` did, so those two paths still printed "Puggles group"; the ink threshold was raised so a pale-gray card background reads as paper instead of becoming a black slab that swallows its own artwork; the too-small gate now measures the artwork's true source resolution rather than its size after the bounded scan; "T & T group" matches club "T&T" the same way `clubKey` already treats them as one club; and a PNG whose header claims absurd dimensions is refused before it is ever decoded.

### Verification
Rendered Marvin's exact label — the real custom Puggles asset, the real "Puggles group" value — and confirmed the wordmark fills the icon zone in solid black with no group line. Four new golden cases (light-cyan, padded, ghost, white-on-dark) with a new icon-zone invariant that counts only thermally printable ink (luminance < 128): with binarization removed, the cyan case drops to 0.10% zone coverage — the two-eyes speck from the photo, quantified — and fails. Negative-controlled the crop and the Puggles rule the same way. An end-to-end test proves enrichment through the real HTTP path produces a byte-identical label to the suppressed render while "Sparks A" survives. 843 assertions across eleven suites, all green.


## [5.6.0] - 2026-08-01
The display key is on the front page instead of buried, the extension says whether names are encrypted, and an app update now updates the extension too.

### "Where do I access the display key?"
It was in Settings → below Pusher → *Realtime privacy — display key*. Reachable, but only if you already knew it existed — which is a poor place for the one control that decides whether children's first names ride a public channel in the clear.

Three changes:

- **A "Names on the Welcome Screen" card at the top of the dashboard**, above the fold, before any tab. Green with the key fingerprint when names are encrypted; red and explicit when they are not — *"anyone who views a screen's page source can subscribe from anywhere and read every child's first name"*. Its **Set up the display key** button opens the Settings tab, scrolls to the key, and flashes it, so the button lands you on the control rather than at the top of a long form.
- **`http://localhost:3456/#display-key` is now a real deep link**, which is what the extension points at.
- **The card stays quiet for a church with no welcome screen.** No Pusher configured means no names on the wire and nothing to warn about.

### The warnings that should have made this findable were rendering BLANK
`/health` warnings are a mix of `{type, message}` objects and bare strings. The dashboard renders `w.message` — which is `undefined` for a string — so it painted an **empty yellow box**. Both realtime-privacy warnings and the phone-PIN warning were affected: the three loudest warnings in the codebase were the invisible ones. All warnings are objects now, and the renderer also tolerates strings so an older server paired with a newer page degrades to readable text rather than a blank rectangle.

Related: `publishState.configured` was only set by `publish()`, so from startup until the first event of the night the server reported Pusher as *not configured*. The privacy banner would have said "no welcome screen connected" to a church that has one — and only turned red after the first child's name had already gone out plaintext. It is now set when the Pusher client is constructed.

### The extension now says whether names are encrypted
Two places, because "the extension" means two different surfaces depending on where you go looking:

- **The check-in panel** on the TwoTimTwo page gets a status row: locked and green with the key fingerprint, or red with a link straight to the dashboard setting.
- **The extension's Settings page** (`chrome://extensions` → Details → Extension options) gets a *Realtime privacy — display key* card, directly below the Pusher card it belongs with. Same three states, plus an **Open the print server dashboard** button that lands on the key.

The Settings page shows status and links out rather than offering its own Generate button — and that is a deliberate choice, not an omission. It *could* show the key: it runs at a `chrome-extension://` origin, which the server trusts on loopback, which is why the Pusher secret already loads there. The reason not to is operational. Rotating the key blanks names on **every** screen at once until the new value is pasted into each one, and the safe ordering — generate, copy into the screens, only then save — is a sequence, not a button. Two surfaces implementing that sequence is two chances to get it subtly different, on the one control that can take every welcome screen down mid-club.

**State only, never the key — on both.** The panel is injected into a page served by twotimtwo.com, so anything rendered there is readable by that site's scripts, which is also why the server redacts `displayKey` for every non-loopback caller. A test asserts the panel cannot render the key even if `/health` were to send one.

### An app update now updates the extension
Previously the extension was not shipped in the `.exe` at all. Updating it meant: notice the version banner, find the zip, download, unzip, remove the old entry in `chrome://extensions`, Load unpacked again. In practice it drifts months behind the print server and nobody notices, because the check-in page keeps working — just against an older content script.

**What is not possible:** Chrome never auto-updates an unpacked extension, and it only honours a self-hosted `update_url` for Web Store or enterprise-policy installs. There is no silent update available for how this extension is distributed, and this release does not pretend otherwise.

**What is:** the folder Chrome loads is now a folder the installer owns.

- `chrome-extension/` ships inside the `.exe` as an extra resource.
- On every launch the app syncs it into `%APPDATA%\Awana Label Printer\chrome-extension` — a path that survives updates, unlike `resources/`, which an update replaces wholesale and would leave Chrome pointing at a folder that vanished.
- Load *that* folder unpacked once. From then on the cost of an extension update is **restarting Chrome**, and the widget tells you when one is owed: *"Extension v5.6.0 is installed — restart Chrome to load it"*, instead of the old "reload extension", which read as "go download it again".
- Tray → **Open Chrome extension folder**, and dashboard → Diagnostics → **Copy folder path**, so finding it is not a scavenger hunt.

The copy is careful because Chrome may be reading that folder while it happens: every file is written to a temp name and renamed into place (a half-written `content.js` is a broken extension on the one page that must not break), files dropped by a new version are removed rather than left to be loaded alongside new code, an identical version is skipped entirely rather than rewritten on every launch, and an implausible source folder is refused rather than mirrored into the operator's profile next to `config.json` and `clubbers.csv`.

The folder path is **loopback-only** in `/health`. The version travels to the check-in site (the extension needs it for the banner); the path does not, because it contains the operator's Windows username and `/health` is CORS-readable from that site.

### Verification
47 new assertions for the extension sync, plus new coverage of the privacy badge, the warning shape, and the loopback gate — 774 across eleven suites, all green. Each new guard was negative-controlled by removing it and confirming the tests go red: the stale-file prune, the source-size refusal, the loopback path gate, and the key-leak check. The extension's Settings page was driven in real Chromium with the extension actually loaded, at its real `chrome-extension://` origin — the first attempt served the page over http from a spare port, which the server's CORS allowlist correctly refused, so the harness was fixed rather than the allowlist. The dashboard was driven in real Chromium end to end — red banner and readable warnings with no key, the jump button scrolling and flashing the right block, the deep link, the Diagnostics path, and the banner turning green with only the fingerprint (never the key) after saving one.


## [5.5.1] - 2026-08-01
The check-in panel no longer traps you when you tick "Also register in TwoTimTwo".

> Split out of 5.5.0 rather than folded into it: v5.5.0 was already tagged and
> published — `.exe` and all — before this fix merged, so claiming it there
> would have described a release that does not contain it. The tag is not
> reusable either (republishing reuses the old ref, so the build would never
> pick up the new commit), which is why this is a new version rather than a
> re-cut.

### The panel could grow past the bottom of the screen with no way to scroll
Ticking **Also register in TwoTimTwo** reveals four more controls — guardian name, guardian phone, birthdate, and gender/grade. On a laptop at the check-in table that pushed the panel past the bottom of the window, and because the panel was `overflow: hidden` with no height limit and sat in a widget pinned at `top: 55px` with nothing constraining it either, the overflow was simply **clipped**. No scrollbar, no way to reach the fields — mid-check-in, with a child at the door.

Measured on a 700px-tall window: the panel already overflowed by 60px with the form closed, and by 199px with it open. Every one of those 199 pixels was unreachable.

The panel is now a column bounded by the viewport: the green header stays pinned (so the close button is always available — it is the escape hatch when anything else goes wrong), and the body below it scrolls.

Three things beyond the raw fix, because "it technically scrolls now" would not have solved the complaint:

- **A fade at the bottom edge when there is more below.** Styling `::-webkit-scrollbar` is not enough — Chromium draws overlay scrollbars that occupy 0px and only appear while you are already scrolling, so a panel with hidden content looks exactly like one that has been cut off. The fade is visible at rest, and disappears at the end of the list so it never implies content that is not there.
- **Ticking the box scrolls the form into view and focuses the first field.** A form that appears below the fold on an unchanged-looking panel is the same "where did it go" problem in a different shape.
- **The register box says "All four are required by TwoTimTwo".** It always did require all four, but previously said so only *after* Print was pressed.

Also: the panel is wider (320px), which stops "Night Test" and "Quick Mode" wrapping onto two lines; the scrollbar gutter is reserved so content does not jump when it appears; scrolling to the end no longer scrolls the page behind it; and restoring the panel after minimising keeps the column layout instead of collapsing back to a plain block.

Verified in a real browser at 1280x700 by injecting the actual content script: the panel stays inside the viewport with the form open, the body scrolls to its end, the grade selector and the close button are both reachable, and the fade appears and clears correctly. The same script run against the previous code reproduces the original overflow, so the test genuinely covers the reported bug.


## [5.5.0] - 2026-08-01
The server now starts on every launch of the app — including the very first one — plus a one-click Start Server button everywhere, an always-visible update status, and club logos that print crisp instead of speckled.

### The server starts the moment the app does
Field testing surfaced the gap: install the app, and nothing is listening on port 3456 until the setup wizard is completed — the server literally did not exist before "Save & Start" was clicked. Now the print server starts on every launch, first run included. Before setup it prints to the system default printer; the wizard save restarts it with the chosen one. The tray icon and its status appear immediately too, and first-run also registers the launch-on-boot entry (the wizard checkbox can still turn it off), so an installed machine comes back up printing after a reboot even if setup was interrupted.

Because the server module is require-cached across these restarts, its load-time printer name and config snapshot went stale the moment settings changed — with a pre-setup start it would have been frozen EMPTY. The Electron shell now pushes the saved printer and the merged config.json into the live module (`setPrinterName()` + `applySavedConfig()`) on every restart, the same live-sync rule that fixed the stale-PIN bug.

### Launching the app IS the fix
Double-clicking the desktop shortcut while the app was already in the tray used to just open the settings window. It now health-probes port 3456 first and starts the server if nothing answers — the operator's natural "it isn't printing" gesture actually repairs the situation. The same one-click start lives in the tray menu ("▶ Start print server" when it's down, "Restart print server" when it's up) and as a green **▶ Start Server** button right in the settings window's failure card.

### Auto-update you can see
The updater worked but was invisible until a download had already finished. The tray now always shows the installed version and exactly where the updater is: "Checking…", "Downloading update vX…", "⬇ Restart to update to vX", or "✓ Up to date". The settings window gained a permanent version card with a **Check for Updates** button that answers out loud — newest version, downloading (with percent), ready to restart, or can't reach the update server. `runAfterFinish` is now pinned explicitly in the NSIS config so install → app launches → server up stays true by contract, not by default.

### Club logos print crisp instead of speckled
The photo evidence: Sparks and T&T logos printing as pixelated mush. Root cause was in the extension — it captured every club image onto a fixed 64×64 canvas, and the label renderer then blew that up to a ~317-pixel icon zone (76pt at 300 DPI), a 5× upscale whose blurry edges the 1-bit thermal printer dithered into speckle. The extension now captures at up to 320px (never above the image's own resolution), and the renderer refuses to upscale any logo more than 2× — below that it falls back to the solid-ink monogram badge, which prints crisp, and keeps the club name in the text area since initials alone don't identify the club. Rejecting a too-small logo beats printing an unrecognizable one; update the extension to get real logos back at full quality.

The check-in panel no longer traps you when you tick "Also register in TwoTimTwo".

## [5.4.0] - 2026-08-01
Children's names are encrypted on the realtime channel. Plus volunteer training mode, a child-identity fix, two config-loss bugs, and CI that actually runs the tests.

### Demo mode: print a real label, touch nothing else
There was no safe way to rehearse. Driving a fake check-in through `POST /print` does the real thing in every respect, and each effect causes lasting damage during a practice run: `print-history.json` feeds `/checkin-csv-export`, which is imported **back into TwoTimTwo**, so a pretend child gets recorded as having attended; `attendance.json` is the permanent season ledger, and padding it makes real milestone lines ("10th club night!") wrong for the rest of the year; the `checkin` publish and recap buffer put a fake child's name on the lobby TV by name, mid-service; and `publishTally` inflates tonight's counts on every screen.

`POST /print` now takes `demo: true`. It prints a REAL label — so a volunteer sees actual output, with real roster enrichment and allergy icons — carrying the same diagonal TEST band `/canary` already uses, and skips all four effects plus the duplicate window (repeating a demonstration is the normal case, not a double-tap). A failing demo print is also silent: no history row and no `ops` print-failure event, so a training mishap never looks like a lost label. This generalises what `/canary` already did for one hardcoded name.

### Same-named children no longer merge into one history row
Print history was keyed on a lowercased "first last" string, so two children who share a name became one row. Three real consequences: the CSV export that TwoTimTwo re-imports recorded only one of them as present; tonight's stats under-reported the room; and a by-name `/reprint` could fetch the wrong child's label — and a label is a safety artifact carrying allergy icons and photo-consent flags.

The extension solved this on its side long ago with `identityKey()`, and has been **sending** TwoTimTwo's `clubberId` on every check-in all along — the server simply discarded it. It is now stored on the row and threaded through every writer. Identity is id-first with a name fallback, so rows written before the field existed still resolve and a mid-season upgrade doesn't orphan the night's history.

### The offline label now says what it cannot know
The extension's offline fallback renderer draws only first name, last name, club and icon — no allergy icons, no birthday, no photo-consent flag. It cannot do better: that path fires only when the print **server** is unreachable, and every safety field is derived server-side from the roster CSV, which the extension has never held.

So the hazard was never the missing icons — it was that the label still *looked* complete. A volunteer who has learned "no peanut icon means no peanut allergy" would read an offline label as safe. It now carries an inverted `OFFLINE — CHECK ALLERGY LIST` band (inverted so it survives a 1-bit thermal print and can't be mistaken for part of the normal layout). A label that admits what it doesn't know is safe; one that quietly omits an allergy is not.

### Children's first names are now encrypted on the realtime channel
The Pusher channel is **public**. Subscription is granted by possession of the app key, and that key must ship in the display's public bundle for a screen to connect at all — so anyone who viewed the page source could subscribe to `awana-channel` from anywhere in the world and watch every child's first name arrive live, every Wednesday, forever. This was not a misconfiguration: Pusher public channels have **no server-side authorization primitive**. It is absent from the product. The display repo's SECURITY.md documented the exposure at length and concluded that closing it would require a backend neither repo has.

It does not. `checkin`, `recap` and `birthdays` are now sealed with AES-256-GCM under a key only this server and the church's own screens hold, so Pusher relays ciphertext it cannot read. The other seven events (`tally`, `tonight`, `points`, `schedule`, `notice`, `ops`, `canary`) stay in the clear **on purpose**: they are counts and church-authored copy, none of it PII, and their readability is what lets a screen tell "the pipe is down" from "I can't read the names" from "quiet night". Encrypt everything and all three look identical — and the last one is the dangerous case, because nobody investigates a quiet night.

**The name events are the only thing that can stop.** Clock, weather, counts, countdown, slides and any CLUB CANCELLED notice never need the key. A missed setup step is never an emergency.

Setup is once, ever: dashboard → **Realtime → Generate display key**, then paste the same value into each screen (Settings → Connection → Display key), then press **Test Night Systems**, which gained a third `display key` stage that publishes a sealed test frame so a wrong key surfaces at 5:45 rather than mid-service. `/health` reports whether names are actually being encrypted and warns loudly when they are not, because "we set that up" must be a fact rather than a belief. Generating deliberately does **not** save the key — the operator copies it into the screens first, so a mistyped paste cannot lock every screen out of a key the server has already committed to.

Rollout has no flag day. The display shipped first and is plaintext-tolerant with no key set, and this server publishes plaintext until a key exists, so neither side can break the other by deploying first. Anti-downgrade lives on the consumer, where it belongs: once a *screen* holds a key it refuses an unsealed name event, so a silent downgrade is impossible in the configuration that matters.

Three details are load-bearing rather than polish:

- **Padding is part of the spec.** GCM is CTR-based and adds no padding, so an unpadded envelope reveals `len(firstName) + len(club)` exactly — and club is inferable by correlating the *plaintext* `tally`. Against a known roster over a season that is a real re-identification channel; it would quietly reduce the claim from "cannot read the names" to "can often guess the names". Every sealed `checkin` is padded to one identical size and a test fails the build if two ever differ. The bulk events use a coarse ladder instead, because a fixed worst-case pad would exceed Pusher's 10 KB per-event ceiling outright.
- **AAD binds a frame to its event name**, so a `checkin` ciphertext cannot be replayed as a `recap`.
- **A fresh random IV per frame.** Never a counter, never derived from a clock — a repeated (key, IV) pair in GCM is catastrophic rather than merely weak.

Two new suites, 104 assertions. `test-envelope.cjs` treats the negative cases as the actual product: wrong key, mismatched key id, a single flipped ciphertext byte, a tampered auth tag, a substituted IV, a truncated frame, and cross-event replay must all be **refused**, with no partial plaintext ever returned. `test-server-realtime.cjs` runs a real server and asserts a name genuinely leaves the process as ciphertext, that the key applies without a restart, and that printing still succeeds through all of it — the printing guarantee outranks the pipe, always.

Both repos are pinned to one committed interop fixture (`envelope-vectors.json`, mirrored byte-identically like `contract-vectors.json`). Two implementations of one wire format — Node's `crypto` here, WebCrypto there — is exactly the situation where both sides pass their own tests and no name ever reaches a screen. Verified beyond the unit tests: real Chromium opens all seven Node-sealed envelopes exactly and rejects both a flipped byte and a cross-event replay.

### `generateLabel` takes an options object
The renderer had **fourteen positional parameters**. Reading a call site meant counting commas to work out whether the seventh `false` was `isBirthday` or `stepUp`, and two callers had already drifted in exactly the way that invites: `/reprint` passes nothing for visitor, step-up, shares, the "Go to:" line or the milestone line — because print history never stored them, so a reprint has quietly differed from the label it reprints — and the connect card smuggles its greeting through the `handbookGroup` slot, which is why that greeting inherits a 30-character truncation nobody chose.

All ten call sites now pass one named object, and a non-object argument throws instead of rendering. That last part matters more than it looks: a leftover positional call would otherwise produce a label with a first name and nothing else — which prints, and looks almost right, which is the worst failure available for something carrying allergy icons.

The conversion is **byte-identical by construction** and the 18 golden-image baselines are the proof rather than the claim. They caught a real mistake during the work: 17 cases matched exactly while the all-fields torture case differed by 38% of its pixels, because one multi-line case had not been converted and was rendering a blank label. A signature refactor that only ran the unit tests would have shipped that.

The golden suite also learned something from CI. It gated its pixel comparison on `process.platform === 'linux'`, which turned out to be far too coarse: the runner is Linux too, with different font packages, so identical code rendered different glyphs and every baseline missed by ~9% of its pixels. A gate that red-lights on a font-package bump is a gate somebody deletes. The baselines now record a fingerprint of the font stack that produced them and compare pixels only when it matches, saying so loudly otherwise instead of either failing (noise) or passing silently (a lie). What CI enforces in its place is font-independent and genuinely load-bearing — determinism, ink coverage, and pairwise distinctness between cases — all three of which catch the blank-render bug above.

The golden cases are now declarative models rather than positional argument arrays, with a small adapter in the harness, so the next signature change touches one function instead of eighteen fixtures — and the baselines keep policing pixels across a refactor rather than being regenerated, which would let the gate certify its own change.

This is the groundwork for the per-club label template editor; it is landed on its own because it stands on its own.

### Who's still here — contract v4
TwoTimTwo's `/clubber/checkout` page turns out not to be a checkout *form*: it is the live list of children **currently checked in**, each with a button to check them out, and a row vanishes once they are. So "who is still here" needs no departure event to miss — it is simply the set of rows.

The extension scrapes that page (the print server cannot: only the volunteer's browser holds the TwoTimTwo session) and POSTs first names and clubs to `POST /feed/checkout`, which publishes a new `checkout` event. It is **sealed with the same AES-256-GCM transport** as the other name-bearing events, and it needs that more than they do: a list of children not yet with a parent is the most sensitive payload this system produces.

Four scraper guards, each stopping one specific way this could tell a lobby the building is clear while children are still in it: the page must positively identify itself (a redirect or session timeout reads as *unknown*, not *empty*); the data table is the **second** table, so a naive `querySelector('table')` would parse an unrelated notices table and find nobody; a **club filter left touched** by a volunteer makes whole clubs look picked up, so a filtered page is refused outright; and rows found but none parsed means selector drift, which is again *unknown* rather than *empty*. Only the page's own "nobody is checked in" placeholder may publish an empty board. All four were verified by removing each guard and watching the suite go red.

The `printed` count is filled in by the **server**, not trusted from the extension, and is computed on the **local** calendar day. That distinction matters: history timestamps are UTC, and a 17:30–20:00 club night straddles UTC midnight for most of the US winter, so a UTC-day filter would silently drop the second half of the night and publish a fresh, plausible, badly-wrong number in the middle of pickup.

**This feature is not a headcount and the display is required to say so.** It reflects whether volunteers *recorded* checkout, which during a pickup rush often lags. The board is off by default, stops naming individuals once the list gets short (a list of two names points at two specific unattended children), and words everything as "not checked out yet".

A new suite (`test-checkout-parser.cjs`, 42 assertions) covers the parser, all four guards, the feed validator and the transport. It needs a DOM, so `jsdom` joins devDependencies — pinned to `^25` deliberately, because jsdom 26+ pulls an undici that calls a Node 21+ API and would break `npm test` on the Node 20 that CI and the shipped Electron app both run.

### Clearing a PIN or a key now actually clears it
Found while testing the above, and the more serious half of it is **pre-existing**. Both `POST /config` paths can delete a key — `delete next.phonePin` when the operator clears the PIN, `delete next.displayKey` for the display key — but the live-process sync was `Object.assign(config, next)`, and `Object.assign` copies properties without ever removing them.

So clearing the phone PIN wrote `config.json` correctly while the running auth gate, which reads `config.phonePin` per request, **kept accepting the old PIN until someone restarted the server**. An operator revoking a PIN they believed had leaked had every reason to think it was gone; it was not. `applySavedConfig()` now makes the live config mirror the file exactly, deletions included, and the regression test asserts both the PIN and the display key really do stop working the moment they are cleared. Verified by restoring the old one-line behaviour and watching all three assertions fail.

### Saving Electron settings no longer erases the security config
`config.json` has several writers with very different views of it. The print server owns the security and realtime keys — `phonePin`, `lanAccess`, `allowedOrigins`, the four Pusher credentials — plus the `schedule`, `historyRetentionDays`, `connectCard` and `worksheetPrinter`. The Electron setup wizard owns exactly three: `printerName`, `checkinUrl`, `launchOnBoot`.

The Electron writer replaced the whole file with the renderer's three-key object, so one click on Save in Settings deleted every server-owned key — and because the handler restarts the server immediately afterwards, the loss went live at once. Three unrelated failures from one click, none of them reported: phone check-in refused every request (the v5.3.0 gate fails closed with no PIN, which is the safe direction but looks like a broken phone page), the lobby TV lost its Pusher credentials and went dark, and late arrivals stopped being routed because the schedule was gone. The realistic trigger is the worst possible moment — the printer jams mid-event, a volunteer opens Settings to pick the backup printer, and saves.

Writes are now a **merge** of the renderer's patch over what is on disk, via a new `electron-app/src/config-store.js` that is deliberately Electron-free so it can be unit-tested, and are written tmp-then-rename so a crash mid-write cannot truncate the file either. The `save-config` handler now acts on the merged result rather than the patch, since the patch alone lacks everything `startServer` needs.

Separately, the deprecated PowerShell installer read-modify-writes correctly but called `ConvertTo-Json` with no `-Depth`; PowerShell 5.1 defaults to depth 2, which serialises `schedule[].label` as a type-name string instead of JSON — silent corruption rather than clean loss. Both call sites now pass `-Depth 10`.

A sixth suite (`test-config-store.cjs`, 31 assertions) covers the merge, first-run creation, corrupt and non-object config files, and the `-Depth` flag. Because the bug was a bare `writeFileSync` in `main.js` rather than a wrong merge, it also asserts at the source level that nothing bypasses the store. Both halves were verified by reintroducing each bug and watching the suite go red.

### CI runs the test suites now
All four suites — event contracts, server helpers, the v5.3.0 trust model, extension identity — existed and passed for several releases while being invoked **only by hand**. The only automated check was the label render smoke test. So the security suite proving the roster isn't reachable from the network could have started failing and no push would have noticed.

`webpack.yml` gains a test job and its push trigger widens from `main` to every branch; `build-electron.yml` gains the same job and `build` now needs it, so a tag cut from a green `main` still can't publish an `.exe` without re-verifying the contract and the trust model. Verified by breaking `security.js`'s loopback check and watching CI go red.

A fifth suite (`test-server-demo.cjs`, 23 assertions) covers demo mode. Its tests are deliberately paired: every "demo writes nothing" assertion has a control running the same request WITHOUT the flag and asserting it DOES record — otherwise the suite would pass just as happily if `/print` were inert. 713 assertions now pass across ten suites.

## [5.3.0] - 2026-07-27
Security and privacy release. An audit of both repos found that the print server exposed children's names and allergy data to anyone on the church network, and to any website open in the volunteer's browser. Nothing here changes how a label prints; all of it changes who can read the roster.

**Nothing was leaked into git.** No roster CSV, history file or Pusher secret has ever been committed to this repo — that was checked across the full history. The exposure was on the running server, and in what a *future* commit could have published (see the `.gitignore` item below).

### The server was listening on every network interface
`app.listen(PORT)` omits its host argument, which binds `0.0.0.0` — every interface — even though the file header claimed "listens on http://localhost:3456". Combined with no authentication on the roster endpoints, any device on the church WiFi (guest network included, if it is flat) could fetch tonight's children and their allergy list:

```
curl http://<laptop-ip>:3456/stats/tonight
```

That endpoint returns full names, **allergy tokens**, birthday-week children, and the **no-photo-consent** list. `GET /history`, `/checkin-csv-export`, `/siblings` and `POST /phone/roster` were comparably open.

The server now binds **loopback only** by default. A default install is not reachable from the network at all — not merely PIN-protected there. LAN access (needed for phone check-in) requires the new `lanAccess` setting **and** a PIN; enable it without a PIN and the server stays on loopback, says so at startup, and raises a `/health` warning rather than silently exposing the roster.

### The phone PIN failed open, and was brute-forceable
`phonePinOk()` began `if (!pin) return true` — no PIN configured meant *no check at all* on the LAN, so the default install served the whole roster to the network. It also compared with `===` (timing-leaky) and had no rate limiting, so a 4-digit PIN fell in seconds. And `GET /config` handed the PIN out to any caller with no `Origin` header — i.e. to `curl` from any phone on the WiFi — which made the PIN self-defeating.

Now: PIN enforcement fails **closed**, uses a constant-time compare, locks an address out after 8 failures, and is applied by a single app-level gate ahead of every route instead of a per-route opt-in that `/stats/tonight`, `/history` and `/checkin-csv-export` had simply never been given. The Pusher secret and the PIN are readable only from loopback, never from the LAN even with a valid PIN.

### `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *` let any website read the roster
`app.use(cors())` set a wildcard ACAO on every response, and a browser lets a page **read** a response bearing that header. So any site the volunteer visited while the server ran could `fetch('http://localhost:3456/stats/tonight')` and take the names and allergies — no network access required. The old code's own comment noted that a hostile tab could POST here; the read side was the larger hole.

CORS is now an allowlist (the extension, `*.twotimtwo.com`, this server's own pages, plus an optional `allowedOrigins`) which echoes the exact origin and never `*`. Mutating requests carrying a non-allowlisted `Origin` are refused outright — a form POST is never preflighted, so the allowlist alone would not have stopped writes.

The origin check guarding the secrets had a second hole: it accepted `origin.endsWith(':3456')`, so a page served from `http://evil.example:3456` qualified. It now requires a loopback host as well as the port.

### Stored XSS in the dashboard, escalating to secret theft
`POST /print` is unauthenticated and wrote `firstName`/`lastName` verbatim into `print-history.json`; the dashboard rendered them with `innerHTML` unescaped. A crafted name therefore became script running on `http://localhost:3456` — the one origin trusted with the Pusher secret and the PIN — which it could then read from `/config` and exfiltrate. The allergy, no-photo and birthday flag lists, the club chips, the failures list and the diagnostics rows had the same defect, and the schedule editor had the attribute-injection variant.

Every interpolation of an outside value now goes through `esc()`. Names are also length-capped and control-character-stripped on the way into the history file, but the output escaping is the actual fix. A static check in the test suite fails the build if any of those fields is interpolated unescaped again — verified by reintroducing the bug and watching it fail with the line number.

### A poisoned config could hand an arbitrary URI to the Windows shell
`POST /config` gated only `pusherSecret` and `phonePin`, so **any** origin could set `checkinUrl`, with no validation whatsoever. That value reaches `shell.openExternal()` (Electron, at launch and on tray click) and `Start-Process` (legacy installer) — both of which pass a non-`http` scheme to the OS handler. `checkinUrl` is now validated as plain `http(s)` before it is persisted *and* again at each sink, the same treatment `worksheetPrinter` already had.

### `.gitignore` did not cover the files a live install writes
The important one for anyone who forks this repo. `DATA_DIR` defaults to `print-server/` itself for legacy script installs, so a running install writes **inside the git working tree** — but only `clubbers*.csv` was ignored. A `git add -A`, or a pull request from a machine that had run the server, would have published `config.json` (**the Pusher app secret and the phone PIN**), `households.csv` (guardians, addresses, phone numbers), `print-history.json` and `attendance.json`.

All of those are now ignored. New `SECURITY.md` documents the trust model, what it deliberately does *not* defend against, and a fork checklist: audit history for committed data, rotate credentials, set your own church identity, and point `install-and-run.ps1` at your own repo (`$RepoSlug` — a fork previously downloaded *upstream's* code, silently discarding its own changes).

### Real children's names in the sample data
The public marketing page rendered a real child's first and last name on its example label, and `data.ts` carried two more in its mock roster — inherited by every fork and published to GitHub Pages. Replaced with synthetic placeholders matching the file's existing style.

### Installers ran unverified downloads with admin rights
`install-and-run.ps1` downloaded the Node.js and PowerShell 7 MSIs and executed them elevated with no integrity check. HTTPS from a known host is a reasonable trust anchor, but not a sufficient one for an elevated execution. Both are now Authenticode-verified (publisher, not a pinned hash, so it survives a version bump) and refuse to run otherwise.

### Also
- History is pruned by **age** as well as row count (`historyRetentionDays`, default 60) — a quiet church previously kept every child's name and check-in time indefinitely. Pruning applies on read, so an existing over-long file shrinks on the next run.
- Removed the `cors` dependency; the policy is 40 lines in `security.js` and no longer needs it.
- `AWANA_PORT` added so the test suite can bind off 3456 without colliding with a real install. The default is unchanged.
- The phone page now distinguishes "locked out" from "wrong PIN" instead of reporting a WiFi problem.
- New `print-server/security.js` holds the whole trust model as pure functions, with 100+ unit assertions in `test-server-helpers.cjs` and 72 end-to-end assertions in the new `test-server-security.cjs` — including one that starts a default-configured server in a child process and proves it cannot be reached on the LAN address at all.

## [5.2.2] - 2026-07-27
Two label-rendering fixes found by actually looking at rendered labels rather than only asserting on them in tests.

### The handbook group could be hidden behind the allergy icons
The bottom-right icon row (allergies, birthday cake, share balance, do-not-photograph) is right-anchored on the same band the handbook-group line occupies, so a child with several icons had their group text running underneath them — "Flight 3:16" was partly covered by a cake and a peanut. The handbook group is what sends a child to the correct table, so it has to stay readable. That line now reserves the icon row's width and centres in the space that remains.

### Print Dialog mode dropped the first-timer palette
`POST /label` — the render behind "Print Dialog" mode and the preview image — never passed the extras that `POST /print` does, so a first-time visitor's label came out on a normal white background instead of the inverted palette auto-printing gives them, and late-arrival routing text was missing too. Both paths now build the same extras. (Attendance milestones are deliberately still excluded from this path: that text comes from recording a check-in, and a preview must not record one.) This is the same shape of bug as the photo-consent fix in 5.2.0 — a feature applied to one render path and not its sibling.

## [5.2.1] - 2026-07-27
**The v5.2.0 Windows build did not publish** — its install smoke test caught a packaging bug, so no broken `.exe` ever reached anyone. 5.2.1 is the release that ships.

### The packaged app was missing a module and died on startup
`electron-builder` copies the print server into the app via an `extraResources` **filter that enumerated files by name**. The new `print-server/feeds.js` was never added to that list, so it worked in development and passed every local test, but the installed app's server crashed immediately with `Cannot find module './feeds'` and never answered `/health`. The filter now globs `*.js`, so any future print-server module is packaged automatically.

More importantly, this class of bug can no longer wait 15 minutes for a Windows runner to reveal it: the test suite now cross-checks every local `require('./…')` in the print server against the packaging filter and fails immediately if a module wouldn't ship. Verified by reproducing the exact regression — with `feeds.js` removed from the filter, the suite fails with a message naming the file and the fix.

### Extension fix: a navigation label could be published to the lobby TV as a church announcement.

The new announcement feed looked for an "active" marker on TwoTimTwo's messages page and, absent one, fell back to a bare `.active` selector. TwoTimTwo is a Bootstrap app, where `.active` marks the **current navigation tab** — the check-in pages carry `<li class="active">` in their own tab strip. So on a page with no real active-message marker, the parser would pick up a nav label like "Checkin Report" and broadcast it as an announcement for the lobby screen to display. Now restricted to table rows and an explicit data attribute, with anything inside a nav, tab strip or pagination container rejected outright. The conservative fallback (only read a message when the page has exactly one unambiguous data row) is unchanged.

Version-only bump for the rest of the app: the `.exe` does not contain the extension, so this is an extension-side fix. It ships as 5.2.1 rather than a second 5.2.0 so the downloadable extension zip can't drift from the version the server reports — mismatched versions make the widget nag about a phantom update.

## [5.2.0] - 2026-07-27
The whole "future possibilities" backlog from v5.1.0 — all fourteen items — is now built. v5.1.0 validated what TwoTimTwo actually exposes; this release uses it. The theme: the printer stops guessing and starts asking TwoTimTwo directly, and the screens start showing what TwoTimTwo already knows.

### No child gets missed: check-ins are now reconciled against TwoTimTwo itself (R-1)
Remote check-in detection worked by watching rows disappear from the check-in page's roster — so if a row was missed (a search filter, a re-render, a browser hiccup), that child silently never got a label. The extension now cross-checks TwoTimTwo's own **check-in report** every minute during club and prints anything the diff detector missed. Three safety properties were designed in before the feature: the **first pass never prints** (it seeds dedup from whoever is already checked in, so opening a station mid-event cannot print the entire roster), the baseline is cleared with the other stale-session keys so a new club night re-baselines instead of reprinting the room, and **a pass prints at most 5 labels** — a bigger gap means something is wrong and a volunteer must not be handed sixty labels. The reverse check (printed here but absent from the report) is telemetry only: it surfaces a count and never prints or unprints. A "Sync now" button runs it on demand.

### Labels are tied to a child, not a name (R-4)
Dedup was keyed on lowercased display name, so two children sharing a name were one record. Identity now prefers TwoTimTwo's own clubber id and falls back to the name, threaded through the roster cache, the printed set, and the print payload. Two dedup holes found while reviewing this are fixed: a hand-typed walk-in recorded under a name key would print a **second** label once registration checked them in and the reconcile report returned a real id; and name keys only trimmed their ends, so the report's markup (the name sits between two links, and can carry padding or a newline) could yield `jane  doe` against the roster's `jane doe` — one child treated as two, another duplicate label.

### Siblings are now looked up, not guessed (R-3)
The roster export carries no household id, so "Also here tonight?" had to infer families from phone and address heuristics. The household CSV — whose *Active Clubbers* column lists each household's children directly — is now synced every 30 minutes and is the primary source, with the heuristics kept only as a fallback. `GET /siblings` also accepts a clubber id, so duplicate names resolve to the right family.

### Allergy icons: fewer false alarms, and never a false negative (R-5)
Allergies come from a free-text Notes field, so parsing was noisy ("loves coloring" produced a dye icon). Parsing is now negation-aware — "no known allergies" yields nothing — and the dye match requires a food-dye sense. Critically, **text after an exception marker is always scanned**: "no known allergies except peanuts", "none other than dairy" and "not allergic to nuts but is allergic to eggs" all still flag. Suppressing a whole clause silently dropped those allergies, which is the one direction this code must never fail in. All locked in as regression tests.

### New at the check-in table
- **Award slips (F-1)** — when a child finishes a book or earns an award, a slip prints alongside their label, sourced from the meeting report. Flagged in history so it never masquerades as a check-in in the reprint list.
- **Direct check-in (F-2)** — sibling, phone and Quick Mode check-ins called TwoTimTwo by clicking its modal and polling for the button. They now post to the check-in endpoint directly, with the old click-and-poll path kept as a fallback.
- **One-step walk-ins (F-3)** — the walk-in box can now also register the guest in TwoTimTwo. The label prints regardless of whether the form succeeds.
- **Leader worksheets (F-4)** — handbook agenda PDFs can auto-print at meeting start. Opt-in, because a surprise stack of letter-size paper is worse than none.
- **Attendance safety net (R-2)** — `GET /checkin-csv-export` produces a CSV in the exact format TwoTimTwo's own check-in import expects, so a station that lost its connection reconciles a night's attendance instead of hand-entering it.

### The screens now show what TwoTimTwo knows (D-1 … D-5)
Four new PII-free event types (contract v3: `tonight`, `points`, `schedule`, `notice`) carry aggregates from TwoTimTwo's own reports to the displays: a **lobby ticker** of tonight's counts, a **color-team points scoreboard** on the projector, **calendar-driven next-meeting awareness** so the countdown stops relying on a hand-maintained schedule, and **announcement/cancellation alerts** where a cancellation renders as an unmissable full-width bar. Trek and Journey are also no longer dropped by the projector's club code — their birthdays were silently never celebrated.

### Security: remote code execution in PDF printing (found and fixed pre-release)
Worth calling out plainly. The new worksheet-printing path built a PowerShell command by escaping the printer name for single quotes and then embedding it in a **double-quoted** string — so a name containing a double quote ended the string early and the rest ran as commands. Because the print server intentionally accepts requests from any page on the machine (that is how the browser extension reaches it), **any website open in a volunteer's browser could have run arbitrary code on the laptop being used to check children in.** A persistent variant existed too: the fallback worksheet printer was settable from any origin, so it could be poisoned once and fire later during a legitimate print.

Fixed at the root rather than patched: the file path and printer name are no longer interpolated into the script at all — they are passed to the child process as environment variables, so no value can break out of a string. A validator was added as a second layer (a Windows printer name is a plain label, so quotes, shell metacharacters and control characters mean it is not one) and applied at every entry point including the config write, so a bad value cannot even be stored. The published exploit payload is now refused, verified by test, with 13 regression checks pinning the validator.

Two duplicate-print paths were fixed alongside it: award slips were deduplicated per browser session rather than per date, so closing and reopening the tab reprinted every slip already earned that night (the meeting report keeps listing them); and award dedup ignored the clubber id it already had, so two children sharing a name could suppress each other's slip.

### Check-in defects found by reviewing this release (all fixed pre-release)
A second adversarial pass over the label-printing paths found five more ways a child could get a duplicate label, no label, or **another child's data**. The worst: two children who share a display name resolved to whichever roster row was scanned most recently, so a label could print carrying the other child's club, photo consent and allergy data — and mark that other child as printed, so she then never got a label at all. Names that map to two children are now treated as ambiguous and the code refuses to guess; the right name still prints, and one child's safety data can never be attributed to another. Also fixed: a walk-in could be printed twice once registered (it was the one path that never recorded its print); reconcile could permanently consume check-ins if it fired while printing was switched off; two same-named children checking in within 25 seconds collided in the server's duplicate window so the second was silently never printed; and the new direct check-in double-recorded attendance because posting directly bypasses the handler that removes the roster row, so verification could never succeed and it always fell back to also checking the child in the old way.

### Privacy and safety of the new surface
The only free-text field ever added to the channel is a notice message, and only because it is church-authored copy written *for* public display; it is capped and forced to plain text on both the producer and the consumer. Everything else is counters, team names and dates — the calendar parser reads only the start date and title, never attendee or organizer data. Two hardening fixes landed during review: request-body limits are **scoped** so only the PDF route accepts a large body (CORS is deliberately wide open here so the extension can reach the server, which also means any page the volunteer has open can POST — a global 18 MB limit would let a stray tab push megabytes through a laptop mid-event), and the household ingest refuses a payload that parses to zero households while a good map is loaded.

### Testing
The Chrome extension had **no test coverage at all** before this release. It now has a suite covering the identity/dedup logic that decides whether a child already has a label — and because `content.js` is a single IIFE that exports nothing, the tests extract the real function source and evaluate it rather than re-implementing it (a copy would pass while the shipped code broke). That suite caught the whitespace bug above. Totals: **241 checks in the printer repo** (141 contract + 83 server + 17 extension) and **503 in the display repo**, plus the headless label render and the Playwright countdown-boundary suite.

## [5.1.0] - 2026-07-26
Validated the whole roster/check-in integration against the **real** TwoTimTwo site (kvbchurch.twotimtwo.com) for the first time, instead of the assumed formats it had been coded against. The check-in DOM contract, the `/clubber/csv` export, and the check-in AJAX endpoints are now captured in `docs/TWOTIMTWO.md` so nobody has to re-scrape the site to understand it. Several enrichment paths that were quietly keyed to the wrong columns are fixed, and clubber identity is now anchored to TwoTimTwo's own id.

### The photo/no-photo icon read the wrong consent column (print server)
The real export carries **two** separate consent columns — `Med Release?` (medical treatment) and `Photo Release?` (photography). `HEADER_MAP` folded both onto a single `MedRelease` key, so which one actually decided the label's no-photo camera icon depended on CSV column order — and semantically it was keyed off *medical* release, not photo release. `Photo Release?` now maps to its own `PhotoRelease` field and the no-photo flag reads that, falling back to `MedRelease` only for older single-column/manual rosters. A child whose family declined **photos** is now correctly flagged regardless of their medical-release answer.

### Roster columns were named for a format the site doesn't emit (print server)
`HEADER_MAP` expected `Household ID`, `Primary Contact`, `Address`, etc. The real `/clubber/csv` has none of those — its family columns are `Parent/Guardian#1`, `Parent/Guardian#2`, `Address1`, and `Primary Phone`, and several headers end in a literal `?`. `normalizeHeader()` now strips trailing punctuation, and the new mappings mean sibling detection and allergy/group/birthday enrichment actually engage on real rosters instead of silently degrading to last-name-only grouping and basic labels.

### Sibling grouping now uses the phone number the export actually carries (print server)
The real export has no household id, so `buildFamilyIndex()` was falling all the way through to last-name grouping — which wrongly merges two unrelated "Miller" families and misses blended families with different last names. It now groups by normalized `Primary Phone` first (then guardian+address, then a type-prefixed fallback chain), so blended families are detected and unrelated same-surname families are kept apart. Manual/template rosters with a real `HouseholdID` still take priority.

### Labels are matched to the exact clubber, not just the name (print server + extension)
The extension now reads TwoTimTwo's own `recid`/`club_id` off each `.clubber` row and sends `clubberId` with the print job; the server matches the CSV's `Clubber ID` column exactly before falling back to name matching. Two kids named "Ava Brown", or a middle name on the roster, no longer risk pulling the wrong allergy/photo data. Detection paths that never saw a page row (e.g. a station that loaded mid-event) now backfill the club from the roster so the label isn't club-less.

### New: server-helper test suite pinned to the real export format
`scripts/test-server-helpers.cjs` (wired into `npm test`) exercises `parseCSV`, `normalizeHeader`, `buildFamilyIndex`, `findClubberIn`, and the photo-consent logic against a fixture whose header is the **verbatim** 66-column real export line. If TwoTimTwo renames a column, these tests fail loudly instead of labels silently losing data on a Wednesday night. 41 checks, plus the existing 91 contract checks.

### Post-review hardening (same version, pre-release)
An adversarial review of the above changes caught three real issues, now fixed:
- **No-photo flag was only half-migrated.** `/print` and `/label` read the new
  `Photo Release?` column, but `/reprint`, `/preview`, and the dashboard
  no-photo safety list (`/stats/tonight`) still read `Med Release?` — so a
  reprinted label or the director's "do not photograph" list could disagree
  with the original label for any child whose two consent answers differ. All
  five paths now go through a single `noPhotoFor(record)` helper.
- **Phone-based family grouping could over-merge on placeholder numbers.** A
  sentinel like `000-000-0000` or a shared office line typed into many rows
  would have collapsed unrelated families into one giant sibling group. Phone
  keys now require a full 10–15 digit number with at least 3 distinct digits
  (normalized to the last 10), and contact-name grouping comes before address
  so a family with an inconsistently-filled address still groups — restoring
  the pre-phone `PrimaryContact`-alone behavior for manual rosters.
- **Extension identity could desync for identical names.** The cached `recid`
  was frozen to the first-scanned row while the clickable element tracked the
  latest, so two kids with the same display name could click one row but send
  the other's id. `recid`/`club_id` now move with the element every scan.

Known follow-ups (see the Capabilities & Roadmap page, R-4/R-5): two children
with an *identical* first+last name are still deduped/grouped by name in the
extension and in `GET /siblings` (no clubberId disambiguation there yet); and
allergy parsing intentionally stays permissive on the free-text `Notes` field
(an extra icon is safer than a missed allergy).

## [5.0.3] - 2026-07-25
Bug-fix sweep across the print server and the Chrome extension. No new features; several of these were failing silently.

### Roster enrichment was dead whenever the CSV carried a BOM (print server)
`parseCSV()` didn't strip the UTF-8 byte-order mark. Because TwoTimTwo's export quotes its fields, the BOM sits *before* the first opening quote, so the field parser took the unquoted branch and returned the first header as `"First Name"` — quotes and all. `HEADER_MAP` missed it, every row came back without a `FirstName`, and `findClubber()` therefore matched nobody: allergies, handbook group, birthday cake, and the no-photo flag vanished from **every** label while the server logged a healthy roster count. The mark is now stripped before parsing.

### A bad roster sync could blank the roster for the night (print server)
`POST /update-csv` wrote the payload to `clubbers.csv` and then replaced the in-memory roster with whatever it parsed to — including zero rows, e.g. when the site answers a sync with a login redirect. Both the memory copy and the on-disk copy were destroyed. The CSV is now parsed *before* the write, and a sync that yields zero rows while a good roster is loaded is rejected with 422 and leaves both copies intact.

### Pusher secret and phone PIN were readable by any website (print server)
CORS is deliberately wide open so the content script on twotimtwo.com can reach the print endpoints — which also meant any page open in the volunteer's browser could `fetch('http://localhost:3456/config')` and read `pusherSecret` and `phonePin`, or POST new ones. Those two fields are now limited to callers that legitimately edit them: same-origin requests (the dashboard), `chrome-extension://` origins (the options page), and any origin on the server's own port (the dashboard over the LAN IP). Everything else gets the config with those keys omitted, and a cross-site POST that touches them is refused with 403. Non-secret reads and writes are unchanged, so the extension's `enableDrivenCheckin` lookup still works.

### Saving settings stacked duplicate publish timers (print server / Electron)
The Electron shell restarts the server on every settings save, and `startListening()` re-ran its one-time startup block each time — so each visit to Settings added another set of tally/recap/birthday intervals to the same process and re-fired the prewarm blank print. The startup block now runs once per process.

### Labels 500'd on an explicitly-null club name (print server)
`generateLabel()` called `.trim()` on `clubName`/`lastName` directly. A payload with `clubName: null` defeats the default parameter, so the render threw, the check-in returned 500, and the failure was recorded as a print failure. Text inputs are coerced before layout. Repeated query params on `GET /preview?clubName=…` and `GET /siblings?name=…` (which Express hands back as arrays) are coerced the same way.

### Typing a walk-in guest's name froze remote check-in detection (extension)
`isSearchActive()` pauses the roster-diff scan while a page filter is active, and tried to exclude the widget's own inputs via `closest('#awana-printer-widget')` — but the widget's id is `awana-widget`, so the test never matched, and the walk-in guest field has no id, so the `awana-walkin` prefix test never matched either. Any text in that box therefore stopped remote/phone check-ins from printing until it was cleared. The same wrong selector in `scanCalendarFor()` (which meant our own panel text was scanned for "step up"/"store") is fixed too.

### The check-in page reloaded itself on non-club nights (extension)
The peak-window auto-refresh checked only the clock (5:40–6:00 PM) and never the day, so a tab left open on any other evening reloaded every 30 seconds. It now requires the configured club-night window as well.

### Label markup escaping (extension)
The offline fallback label built its HTML by string concatenation with unescaped names, club names, and the icon URL, all read from the page DOM. They now go through an escape helper.

## [5.0.2] - 2026-07-17
**Stale extension download fixed:** the committed `chrome-extension.zip` (root + `public/`, the file behind the website's "Download chrome-extension.zip" button) still contained the **4.0.0** extension — nothing regenerated it on version bumps, so the site had been serving a two-major-versions-stale extension. Both zips are rebuilt from the current source, and `scripts/bump-version.cjs` now regenerates them on every bump (`zip` on Unix, `Compress-Archive` on Windows) so they can't drift again. Also cleaned up release-page clutter: deleted the empty stray releases/tags (`V5.0.2`, `5.0.1`, `v5.0.1`, `v5.0.0`, `release`) left behind by failed/manual release attempts — a stray "latest" release breaks electron-updater for real users, and a new `delete-release.yml` workflow now exists for this cleanup.

CI-only fix, round two: after 5.0.1 fixed the install-path race, the very next step in the same smoke test broke for the same underlying reason — the CI script's "Seed config and launch" step hardcoded `%APPDATA%\Awana Label Printer` for the app's config file, but the install step had just proven electron-builder names the app folder after package.json's `"name"` field (`awana-label-printer`), not `"productName"`. Guessing the userData path the same way would have hit the identical bug. `.github/workflows/build-electron.yml` now launches the packaged app with `--user-data-dir` (a native Electron/Chromium switch) to pin its data directory explicitly instead of guessing, and captures the app's stdout/stderr to log files that get dumped automatically if `/health` never responds — so any future failure here is diagnosable from logs on the first try instead of another blind guess-and-retag cycle. No application behavior changes.

## [5.0.1] - 2026-07-17
CI-only fix: the release pipeline's Windows install smoke test had a race — the one-click NSIS installer's silent stub can return from `Start-Process -Wait` before a detached child finishes copying files, so a single `Test-Path` check immediately after install intermittently (reproduced on two separate CI runners) reported the app missing even though the build itself was fine. `.github/workflows/build-electron.yml` now polls for the installed exe (up to 60s) and dumps directory/registry diagnostics if it still doesn't appear, instead of a one-shot check right after `-Wait` returns. No app behavior changes in this release.

## [5.0.0] - 2026-07-17
The Windows app (`Awana-Label-Printer-Setup.exe`) becomes the single supported install path — download, run, pick a printer, done. The PowerShell script install is deprecated (still works this release; migrated automatically).

### Print server is now truly portable (root cause of the "slim fallback" problem)
Swapped `canvas` for `@napi-rs/canvas`: prebuilt ABI-stable N-API binaries load identically under plain Node and inside packaged Electron, killing the native-module failure that silently degraded installs to the feature-poor slim server (which is now **deleted** — a server failure shows a visible error box + red tray state instead of quietly printing worse labels). Also ~40 MB of deps instead of ~300 MB. Writable files (config.json, clubbers.csv, history, attendance, event buffer) moved behind `AWANA_DATA_DIR` (Electron sets it to `%APPDATA%\Awana Label Printer`; legacy installs keep writing next to server.js). A bare `require()` of server.js now has zero side effects — sweep/roster-load/publish-timers/prewarm run in `startListening()`, and the legacy VERSION-poll self-update only runs when launched directly (it used to run inside Electron and would have tried to patch files inside the packaged resources).

### Auto-update via electron-updater + smoke-tested releases
The app checks GitHub Releases, downloads in the background, and installs on quit or via the tray's "Restart to update" (never forces a restart mid-club-night). `/update-now` delegates to the shell via the new `setUpdateHandler()` export (legacy installs keep the exit-99 launcher dance). CI now: installs print-server deps **before** packaging (the old workflow shipped an empty `node_modules` — the packaged full server could never load), runs a headless label-render smoke test with PNG artifacts, builds the installer, silent-installs it on a Windows runner and asserts the FULL server answers `/health` + `/preview` with the tagged version — and only then attaches the exe + `latest.yml` + blockmap to the release.

### Foolproof first run + migration from script installs
First launch imports config/roster/history from `C:\output\Print-TwoTimTwo-Labels\print-server`, prefills the wizard, and offers to remove the old desktop/Startup shortcuts. If something else holds port 3456 (usually the old auto-start launcher), the app names the process and offers a one-click stop — killing the launcher's cmd tree so it can't respawn. New: launch-on-boot toggle (silent `--auto-start`, no browser pop), "Print Test Label" button (uses `/canary`'s TEST-banner label), live health panel (roster count/age, printer warnings, phone-check-in URL), and an "Enable Phone Check-in" button that adds the firewall rule via a UAC prompt (the per-user installer can't add it silently — first-run relies on Windows' Allow prompt, now called out in the wizard).

### Website/docs
InstallGuide leads with a download button (`releases/latest/download/Awana-Label-Printer-Setup.exe`, fixed artifact name) + SmartScreen "More info → Run anyway" callout; the `irm | iex` command moved into a collapsed "Previous install method" section. README/SETUP/TROUBLESHOOTING updated (new .exe troubleshooting section); deprecation banner added to `install-and-run.ps1`. Also fixed a pre-existing garbled `Write-Host` in the installer's port-check catch block that would have crashed the trap handler.

## [4.2.1] - 2026-07-17
KVBC-Awana-Countdown retirement housekeeping (docs only — no behavior change).

### CONTRACT.md consumer list updated
The countdown consumer is now Awana-Check-in-Display's `/countdown.html` (the presentation tool absorbed from the retired KVBC-Awana-Countdown repo). The mirror instructions now name the single live mirror (`src/lib/__fixtures__/contract-vectors.json` in the display repo). Verified during the same sweep: this repo never consumed the old repo's `shared/*.json` URLs — the group schedule is dashboard-edited local config (`church-config.json`) — so no code repoint was needed.

### Drift protection (in the display repo)
Awana-Check-in-Display CI now byte-compares its mirrored `contract-vectors.json` against this repo's canonical copy (raw.githubusercontent.com) on every CI/deploy run plus a weekly cron, so a canonical change here that isn't re-mirrored breaks their build instead of silently drifting. The `note` field inside `contract-vectors.json` still mentions KVBC-Awana-Countdown; it is left byte-locked on purpose — editing it would break mirror parity, and cleaning it up requires the two-repo canonical-first re-mirror dance this entry describes.

## [4.2.0] - 2026-07-16
Check-in features wave: phone check-in, sibling suggestions, first-timer treatment, late-arrival routing, attendance milestones, Electron/server consolidation, and a docs rewrite.

### Phone check-in (#17b) — new `/phone` page
Volunteers on the club Wi-Fi open `http://<laptop-ip>:3456/phone` (PIN-gated, set on the dashboard), search the roster, and tap **Check in**. The request queues on the server (`POST /phone/checkin` → pending-actions); the extension long-polls `GET /pending-actions` (25 s hold), drives the real TwoTimTwo check-in in the browser (click row → modal → verify the row vanishes), and reports back (`POST /pending-actions/:id/result`). The phone never prints directly — the label flows through normal detection, so dedup still guarantees exactly one label. The phone shows live status ("Working… → Checked in"). `install-and-run.ps1` adds an idempotent TCP-3456 firewall rule. LAN-trust only (PIN over HTTP) — documented in docs/SETUP.md.

### Sibling suggestions re-enabled, panel-only (#26)
After each check-in the family lookup runs again and an **"Also here tonight?"** panel offers the kid's siblings — one tap drives their check-in. NEVER auto-batches (the quick-mode auto path stays retired). Kill switch: dashboard → "Allow driven check-ins" (also disables phone-driven check-ins).

### First-timer treatment (#27)
Visitor labels now use the inverted (black) palette so they pop out of a stack — palette only, icons and text behave normally (generalized from the Step Up ternary; toggle on the dashboard). Optional **connect card**: a second label for visitors pointing the family to the club's time/location from the group schedule.

### Late-arrival routing (#28)
New dashboard **Group Schedule** editor (club, start time, location, room; `GET/POST /config/schedule`). A check-in later than start + grace (default 10 min, configurable) adds a bold **"Go to: Music, Rm 4"** line to the label, bottom-left, clear of the icon row.

### Attendance milestones (#30)
New compact `attendance.json` ledger (one dates[] per kid, atomic writes) — print history rolls over every ~2 nights, so milestones needed their own store. The 5th/10th/25th/50th club night within the season (Aug 1 boundary) prints "⭐ Nth club night tonight!" on the label. Canary/test prints never count.

### Extension + server consolidation (#16)
- Deleted dead `electron-app/src/checkin-script.js` (never injected — Electron opens the check-in page in the default browser).
- `server.js` is now requireable: `module.exports = { app, startListening }` with a `require.main` guard.
- The Electron tray app prefers the FULL print server (packaged via electron-builder `extraResources`, including node-canvas); the slim HTML-renderer server remains as an explicit fallback if canvas fails to load. Electron installs now get roster enrichment, dedup, history, Pusher, and phone check-in.

### Roster-diff hardening (#17a) + confirmation feed
The safety-net roster scan is now adaptive — every 2 s inside the club-night window (from `/config/church`), 5 s otherwise — and converted from `setInterval` to a self-rescheduling `setTimeout` so a slow scan can never stack. New **Last prints** feed pinned at the top of the widget panel: the last 5 labels with their detection source (🖱 local / 📡 remote / 📱 phone / ⌨ manual) and ✓ printed / 📦 queued state (#29 polish).

### Church config in one place (#50 slice)
The extension fetches `/config/church` once at startup: shares club ids and club-night windows replace hardcodes (baked KVBC fallbacks preserved).

### Docs rewrite (#33)
README rewritten around the extension + Electron (bookmarklet-era copy retired from the top); new `docs/NIGHT-OF.md` print-and-tape one-pager and `docs/SETUP.md` full setup guide (incl. the phone-check-in trust model); TROUBLESHOOTING gains phone-check-in and selector-banner sections.

## [4.1.0] - 2026-07-16
Event bus + night reliability: the print server becomes the single publisher for the whole Awana app family (check-in display + countdown app), with contract-pinned payloads, self-testing selectors, an end-to-end canary, and visible print failures.

### Event bus — new pinned contract (CONTRACT.md + contract-vectors.json)
The print server now publishes five event types on the Pusher channel (only it holds the secret; displays subscribe with the public key). Payload builders live in `print-server/events.js` — pure, structurally incapable of leaking PII (first names only, ever):
- **`checkin` v2** — existing four fields plus `id` (uuid) + `at` (ISO) so displays can dedupe live vs replay. Consumers treat both as optional, so deploy order doesn't matter.
- **`recap`** (every 2 min during club hours) — the last ≤15 check-ins, so a display that reconnects mid-event still celebrates the kids it missed. Buffer persists across a server restart (`events-buffer.json`, today-only).
- **`tally`** (each check-in + every 60 s) — per-club checked-in counts, zero PII. Drives the countdown app's live GameTimeView counts.
- **`birthdays`** (startup + every 10 min on club night) — this week's birthday kids as `{firstName, club, month, day}` (no year, no last name). Kills the countdown app's manual CSV upload chore.
- **`ops`** (`print-failure` / `selector-fail` / `canary`) — operator telemetry: type/club/at only, never a name.
Interval publishers are gated by the club-night window in the new `print-server/church-config.json` (per-church knobs: check-in URL, Pusher channel, club nights, shares club ids — baked KVBC defaults if missing). New `GET /config/church` serves it; `npm run test:contracts` (zero-dep Node script, 91 assertions) pins every payload shape against the canonical vectors.

### Selector self-test (chrome-extension/content.js + POST /selftest)
The extension probes the load-bearing TwoTimTwo selectors (`.clubber`, `.name`, `#lastCheckin`, club icons) 15 s after load and every 10 min, and reports to the server. A hard failure (site redesign) throws a loud red page banner instead of failing silently, and the server publishes an `ops: selector-fail` event on the transition. Modal selectors are verified passively by the driven check-in paths (they only exist while a modal is open).

### Canary — "Test Night Systems" (POST /canary)
One click before doors open proves the whole pipeline: stage 1 prints a real label with a bold diagonal **TEST — NOT A CHECK-IN** band (unique `Canary HH:MM:SS` name defeats the duplicate window; excluded from history, stats, tally, and the checkin event), stage 2 publishes a `canary` event on the bus. Buttons on the dashboard (Night Status card) and in the widget (**Night Test**, which also re-runs the selector probe).

### Print failures are now visible (#15)
The server previously recorded only successes — a jammed printer was invisible. Failed `/print`/`/reprint` calls now land in history (`success:false`, shown struck-red in the dashboard table, excluded from stats), in a `GET /failures` list (last 20, names stay local), and on the bus as `ops: print-failure` (club only). `/stats/tonight` logic extracted to `computeTonightStats()` and shared with the tally publisher.

### Night Status dashboard card
New card on the dashboard: club-night window state, event-bus publish health (last event + timestamp or error), selector self-test result, last canary stages, roster freshness — plus the canary button. `/health` gains `clubNight`, `pusher`, `selectorSelfTest`, `lastCanary`, `printFailures`, and `csv` fields.

## [4.0.0] - 2026-07-11
Major release: widget reprints, live "Tonight" stats, offline roster cache, one-click updates, Med Release no-photo labels, and a fully redesigned website.

### One-tap reprints in the widget (chrome-extension/content.js)
New **Tonight** section in the widget lists today's prints (name, time) with a Reprint button per row — rescues torn/jammed/lost labels without leaving the check-in page. Refreshes when the panel opens, after every successful print, and once a minute while expanded. Uses the existing `/history/today` + `/reprint` endpoints.

### Tonight at a glance (print-server)
- New `GET /stats/tonight`: unique kids checked in, labels printed, visitors, per-club counts, plus safety flags for everyone in the building — allergy kids (with tokens), birthday-week kids, and no-photo kids. Each child counts once regardless of reprints.
- Dashboard gets a "Tonight at a Glance" card: per-club chips and color-coded allergy / no-photo / birthday rows, refreshed every 15 s.
- Print history entries now record the `visitor` flag so visitor counts are accurate.

### Offline roster cache (chrome-extension/content.js)
The scraped roster (names, clubs, logos) is persisted to `chrome.storage.local` (2-week TTL, 400-entry cap) and restored automatically when the page can't render its roster — site down, Wi-Fi drop, offline reload. Widget search keeps working, and selecting a cached kid with no live page row prints the label anyway (label-only; do the TwoTimTwo check-in when the site is back). Combined with the existing print queue, a mid-event outage no longer stops the door.

### One-click self-update
- New `POST /update-now`: the server exits with code 99 after confirming an update exists.
- `launch-awana.bat` treats exit 99 as "re-run the update check" — it downloads the latest installer and restarts on the new version (the launcher already updates on every launch; this adds mid-season one-click updates).
- The widget's update notice and the dashboard banner both grow an **Update now** button.

### Med Release → no-photo label icon (print-server/server.js)
- New CSV column `MedRelease` (aliases: Med/Medical/Media/Photo Release, Photo Permission) parsed as y/n. Only an explicit "n"/"no"/"false"/"0" flags the child — blank or missing prints nothing.
- Flagged kids get a **crossed-out camera** (camera emoji + drawn slash) in the label's bottom-right icon row, and appear in `/stats/tonight` + the dashboard as NO PHOTOS.
- `clubbers-template.csv` updated with the new column; enrichment logs show `NO PHOTO`.

### Website redesigned from scratch
New single-page site (App.tsx + Nav/Hero/Features/InstallGuide/Simulator/Faq components, PrintServerInfo removed): hero with a CSS mock of the real 4×2 label, 3-step "How it works", v4 feature grid, 4-step install guide with copy-to-clipboard command and connection test, the working check-in simulator (now with a functional name filter) styled as a browser mock, and a volunteer FAQ. Inter font, brand green palette, fully responsive.

## [3.9.0] - 2026-07-11
Housekeeping release: sibling check-in disabled for now, widget panel reorganized, dead code removed.

### Sibling check-in disabled (chrome-extension/content.js)
Both triggers — the sibling panel after a normal check-in and Quick Mode's auto-sibling batch — are commented out with `SIBLING CHECK-IN DISABLED` markers. All the underlying functions (`findSiblings`, `showSiblingPanel`, `batchCheckInSiblings`, …) are kept intact so the feature can be re-enabled by uncommenting the two blocks. Quick Mode hint and website copy updated to match ("currently disabled").

### Widget interface cleanup (chrome-extension/content.js)
The expanded panel is reorganized into labeled sections, most-used first:
1. **Search + Quick Mode** at the top
2. **Night Modes** — Step Up Night, Awana Store Night
3. **Printing** — mode selector, Test, printer picker
4. **Walk-in Guest** — name, club, visitor
5. Status lines (queue, roster sync, warnings) and Help at the bottom

New shared `sectionLabel()`/`divider()` helpers replace the hand-rolled duplicate style blocks.

### Dead code removed
- `lastPrintTime` (extension): assigned in four places but never read — the cooldown guard it armed was removed in v3.6.1.
- `printHistory` (server): loaded at startup but never used; `/history` reads the file per request.
- Stale "Text truncation helper" comment block referencing pdfkit, which the server no longer uses.

## [3.8.0] - 2026-07-11
Field-test fixes: duplicate label printed for the first check-in of the night; label redesign per feedback (no left stripe, allergy icons instead of words, handbook group restored).

### Bug fix: same child's label printed twice
First real-machine test: Micah's label printed twice, Sophia's once.
- **Root cause:** POST `/print` is synchronous on the server — PowerShell startup plus a cold printer can take 15–30 s (the server retries the spooler internally, up to ~31 s worst case). The extension aborted the request after only **5 s** and retried; the first request was still succeeding, so the retry printed a second copy. The first print of the night is the cold one, which is why only Micah duplicated.
- **Server fix (root cause):** `/print` now suppresses any request for a name that already printed successfully within 25 s and acknowledges it as `{success, duplicate}` — a client retry, double-tap, or overlapping detection path can never double-print. Deliberate reprints via `/reprint` are not gated.
- **Extension fix:** `/print` request timeout raised from 5 s to 35 s (above the server's worst case) so a slow-but-successful print is never aborted and re-sent.

### Label design (print-server/server.js), per field feedback
- **Left identity stripe removed.** The 3.7.1 per-club pattern stripe (zigzag/rungs/dots…) read as a printing artifact on real labels ("weird looking bar"). Club identity remains via the logo/monogram icon panel and club fonts.
- **Allergy words → icons.** The bold `[NUTS]`-style text chips are replaced with emoji icons (🥜 🥛 🌾 🥚 💧) at 22 pt — no words along the bottom of the label. Unknown tokens fall back to ⚠.
- **Bottom icon row can't collide with text.** The centered text block now reserves 20 pt of bottom space whenever the coin/cake/allergy row is present, so a wide handbook-group line no longer overlaps the icons.

### Bug fix: handbook group missing from labels
Enriched labels printed allergies but no handbook-group line.
- Enrichment now falls back to the generic `Group` CSV column when `HandbookGroup` is absent (TwoTimTwo exports the grouping under a plain "Group"-style header), at all four sites (/print, /label, /preview, /reprint). "All" still suppresses the line.
- Added `handbook` and `handbook time` header aliases to the CSV header map.
- The server now logs **every** parsed CSV column on load (not just recognized ones), so a renamed TwoTimTwo header is visible in the console instead of silently dropping enrichment.

### Website
- "Per-club label design" section: stripe-pattern description and legend removed.
- Allergy tile: "Allergy chips" → "Allergy icons" with the emoji legend.

## [3.7.2] - 2026-06-11
Club logos guaranteed: monogram badge fallback when the client doesn't supply a logo image.

### Why
The icon panel only rendered when the browser extension successfully scraped the club logo `<img>` from the check-in page and POSTed it as `clubImageData`. If the page layout changed, the image failed to load, or a caller hit the API without an image, the label silently lost its entire icon zone. Club identity on the label shouldn't depend on client-side scraping succeeding.

### Fix (print-server/server.js)
- New `CLUB_MONOGRAM` map (P, C, S, T&T, TR, J — TR so Trek can't be confused with T&T).
- The icon panel now always renders for any recognized club: the real logo when `clubImageData` is supplied (unchanged), otherwise a solid-ink monogram badge drawn in the club's own font — crisp on 1-bit thermal output, where the old "decode failed" gray placeholder circle would just dither away.
- A failed logo decode also falls back to the monogram badge instead of the placeholder circle.
- The club-name text line is now hidden only when a *real logo* is shown (a logo self-identifies the club); monogram labels keep the printed club name since initials alone are ambiguous to new volunteers.

### Behavior change
- **Before:** no `clubImageData` → no icon panel at all; failed decode → empty gray circle.
- **After:** recognized club always gets an icon — real logo preferred, monogram badge otherwise. Unknown club names without an image keep the previous full-width text layout.

## [3.7.1] - 2026-06-11
Rework the 3.7.0 per-club design for monochrome thermal printers; harden allergy visibility; fix birthday-cake week bug.

### Why
The 3.7.0 design used official Awana club hues, but the target printer is a 1-bit thermal printer: mid-tone colors dither into mushy, indistinguishable grays. The colored stripe lost its "which club" value, the colored club name and visitor pill *lost* contrast, and the existing tiny allergy emojis were already marginal in grayscale — unacceptable for safety-critical information.

### Per-club design, thermal-first (print-server/server.js)
- `CLUB_THEMES` color palettes replaced with `CLUB_PATTERNS`: each club's identity stripe is now a distinct solid-ink pattern that stays crisp at 300 dpi in pure black and white — **Puggles** dots · **Cubbies** solid bar · **Sparks** zigzag · **T&T** ladder rungs · **Trek** diagonal hatch · **Journey** chevrons. Unknown clubs print no stripe.
- All label text back to full-contrast near-black (club name bold italic black, group #333); separator is a solid 1 pt rule (gradients dither to noise); visitor pill back to black/white; icon panel back to neutral light gray. Step-up labels keep black/amber, stripe pattern drawn in white ink.
- **Allergy chips:** allergens now print as solid-black rounded chips with bold white text (e.g. [NUTS] [DAIRY]) in the bottom-right corner instead of 16 pt emojis — unmissable on thermal output. Cake 🍰 and share-coin glyphs unchanged. Unused `ALLERGY_EMOJI` map removed.
- Verified end-to-end with a test roster (allergies, handbook groups, birthday) and a 1-bit threshold simulation of thermal output: all six patterns distinguishable, chips and groups fully legible.

### Bug fix: birthday cake disappeared after the birthday passed
`isBirthdayWeek()` rolled an already-passed birthday forward to *next year* before the ISO-week comparison, so the cake vanished the day after the birthday — contradicting the 3.6.2 documented behavior ("the whole calendar week containing the birthday"). Now the birthday is tested in both the current and next calendar year against today's ISO week, which restores the full-week behavior and still handles the Dec→Jan ISO-week wrap.

### Website
"Per-club label design" section rewritten for the pattern system; allergy tile corrected ("Bold black chips… NUTS, DAIRY, GLUTEN, EGG, DYE" — the old text described a removed red bar and a SHELLFISH token that never existed in the parser).

### Behavior change
- **Before (3.7.0):** colored stripes/club names that flatten to similar grays on thermal; allergy emojis hard to read; cake only until the birthday itself.
- **After:** black pattern stripes distinguishable in pure 1-bit output; bold inverted allergy chips; cake for the entire calendar week containing the birthday.

## [3.7.0] - 2026-06-11
Feature: per-club label design system (official Awana club colors) + a broad reliability hardening pass on the print server.

### Why
All clubs printed visually identical labels — only the font differed — so volunteers sorting kids at the door had to read the small club line on every label. And several long-standing reliability gaps could degrade or kill the server mid-event: a port collision during update killed the process silently, a locked CSV wiped enrichment data for the rest of the night, and a single spooler hiccup sent a child away without a label.

### Per-club design (print-server/server.js)
Each club now has an accent palette in `CLUB_THEMES`, alongside its existing font personality:
- **Puggles** leaf green / teal · **Cubbies** sky blue / yellow · **Sparks** flame red / yellow · **T&T** green / black · **Trek** orange / charcoal · **Journey** blue / charcoal
- New club identity stripe: a two-tone color bar on the left edge of every label — the at-a-glance "which club" cue.
- Icon panel background and divider are now a light tint of the club primary (derived via a `tint()` helper, no second hardcoded palette).
- Club name prints bold italic in the club primary; the separator rule is a primary→secondary gradient.
- Visitor pill now uses the club primary instead of plain black.
- Step-up labels are unchanged (black/amber) except the stripe, which matches the amber callout. All primaries are mid-dark so monochrome thermal printers flatten them to legible grays.

### Reliability (print-server/server.js)
- **Port bind retry:** `EADDRINUSE` on startup now retries 5× with backoff (the installer can hold port 3456 for a few seconds during updates) and prints an actionable message instead of dying silently.
- **Last-known-good roster:** if `clubbers.csv` becomes unreadable mid-event (EBUSY/deleted/corrupt), the server keeps serving the previous in-memory roster instead of wiping it — labels keep their allergies and groups.
- **Print retry:** one automatic retry (750 ms) on PowerShell print failure — transient spooler errors (printer waking, USB renegotiation) routinely succeed on the second attempt.
- **Atomic writes:** `clubbers.csv` (from /update-csv) and `print-history.json` are written to a temp file and renamed, so a crash mid-write can never leave a truncated file.
- **Club icon cache:** remote club logos are downloaded once (with one retry) and cached in memory, so a Wi-Fi blip no longer costs the label its icon.
- **Collision-proof temp files:** temp PNG/PS1 names now include a random suffix — two prints in the same millisecond no longer delete each other's files.
- **Orphan sweep:** leftover `awana-*.png`/`awana-print-*.ps1` files older than 1 h are removed at startup.
- **Clean JSON errors:** malformed request bodies return `400 {"error": ...}` instead of the default Express HTML stack trace.

### Behavior change
- **Before:** all labels white with gray text; server died silently on port conflict; locked CSV = basic labels for the rest of the night; one spooler error = no label.
- **After:** each club's label carries its official colors; the server survives port conflicts, CSV lock-outs, spooler hiccups, and network blips without losing a print.

## [3.6.2] - 2026-05-05
Fix: birthday cake emoji now displays during the calendar week containing the birthday, not for any birthday within the next 7 days.

### Why
The previous "next 7 days" logic was too broad. At Awana events, displaying the cake emoji the entire week *before* a birthday created confusion — volunteers seeing the cake would expect it to be someone's actual birthday, but it would sometimes be 5+ days away. The cake emoji should signal "this birthday is happening this week" rather than "this birthday might happen in the next week."

### Root cause
`isBirthdayWeek()` function was calculating `diffDays >= 0 && diffDays <= 6`, which displays the cake for any birthday within 7 days, regardless of calendar week boundaries.

### Fix (print-server/server.js)
- Modified `isBirthdayWeek()` to use ISO week number comparison instead of day difference arithmetic.
- Birthday now shows a cake emoji only if it falls within the same calendar week as today (same ISO week number and year).
- Updated documentation (PrintServerInfo.tsx) to clarify that the emoji shows "when a birthday is in the same calendar week" and corrected it to say "cake emoji 🍰 in bottom-right corner" instead of the outdated "red Happy Birthday line".

### Behavior change
- **Before:** A child's label shows a cake emoji for 7 days: from 6 days before their birthday through the day after.
- **After:** A child's label shows a cake emoji only during the calendar week containing their birthday (Mon–Sun or your locale's week start/end).
- **Example:** If a birthday is Thursday May 6, the cake emoji shows from Monday May 4 through Sunday May 10 (the same ISO week), but not on May 3 (prior week) or May 11 (next week).

## [3.6.1] - 2026-05-03
Hotfix: drop the 2-second blanket print cooldown that was silently swallowing the second of any two back-to-back check-ins.

### Why
Volunteer report after v3.0.4: standard click → modal → confirm flow was missing prints. Two parents checking different kids back-to-back would get one label and one missed kid, with no visible error.

### Root cause
`onCheckin` (the fast path triggered by the `#lastCheckin` mutation observer) and `triggerRemotePrint` (the roster-diff fallback) both had a `Date.now() - lastPrintTime < PRINT_COOLDOWN` early-return. Designed as a belt-and-suspenders cross-path dedup, but it was over-broad — it gated on **time** rather than **name**, so a different kid checked in within 2 s of the previous one was dropped without ever reaching `doPrint`.

The actual deduplication mechanism (`printedNames` Set + `batchPrintedNames` Set, both keyed on lowercase name) is sufficient: every print path checks the sets *before* POSTing, and writes to them *before* POSTing, so the race window where the same kid would be printed twice from two different detection paths is already zero.

### Fix (chrome-extension/content.js)
- Removed the `Date.now() - lastPrintTime < PRINT_COOLDOWN` gate from both `onCheckin` and `triggerRemotePrint`. Per-name dedup is unchanged.
- `lastPrintTime` is still updated for diagnostic continuity but no longer gates anything.
- Added a `console.log('[Awana] POST /print:', fullName, ...)` line in `doPrint` so the next time something looks off, the volunteer (or whoever's helping debug) can open DevTools, watch the console, and see exactly which check-ins fired their POST and which didn't.
- `PRINT_COOLDOWN` constant is preserved — it's still used as the polling interval for `flushQueue`.

### Behavior change
- **Before:** two parents back-to-back → first label prints, second drops silently. Three parents in 4 s → only the first label prints.
- **After:** every kid checked in via the standard flow gets a label. Same-kid double-detection is still blocked by `printedNames`.

## [3.6.0] - 2026-05-03
Awana Store Night support: each kid's label gets a small `🪙 N` badge in the bottom-right icon strip showing their current share balance, sourced live from TwoTimTwo's share-balance report.

### Why
On Awana Store nights, kids spend their accumulated shares ("shekels") at a small in-house store. Today the volunteer at the counter has to look every kid up by hand in TwoTimTwo. This change puts the balance straight on the label so they can scan and ring up in one motion.

### Detection (chrome-extension/content.js, options.html / options.js)
- New `isAwanaStoreNight()` reuses the same DOM scanner as `isStepUpNight()`, matching `/store/i` (case-insensitive). The detection helper was factored into a shared `scanCalendarFor(pattern)` so both modes use identical exclusion rules.
- New widget toggle (Auto / On / Off) sits immediately after the Step Up Night row. The hint shows the live auto-detect result and the count of kids currently in the share-balance cache.
- Mirrored on the extension Options page; the two stay in sync via `chrome.storage.local` and the existing `chrome.storage.onChanged` listener. The Options page now uses a small `bindModeSelect(elementId, storageKey)` helper that handles both Step Up and Store toggles.

### Share-balance fetch + cache (chrome-extension/content.js)
- `fetchShareBalances()` issues five parallel `GET https://kvbchurch.twotimtwo.com/report/shekelBalance?club_id=N&output=csv` requests for `N=2..6` (Cubbies, Sparks, T&T, Trek, Journey) using the volunteer's logged-in TwoTimTwo session (`credentials: 'same-origin'`).
- A tiny inline parser handles the simple `"Name","Balance"` two-column CSVs and bails on anything that looks like an HTML response (e.g. a login-redirect page).
- Results are merged into a single map keyed on `lowercase + trim + collapse-whitespace` of the full name, so the double-spaces seen in the source data (`"Avery  McAdam"`) don't break lookups.
- Cache TTL is 5 minutes. `getShareBalance(firstName, lastName)` returns whatever's currently cached and kicks off a background refresh if stale — never blocks the print path.
- Initial fetch fires when Store mode becomes active (widget init, toggle change, options-page change). A per-minute timer refreshes both the auto-detection and the cache count shown in the widget hint.

### Print payload (chrome-extension/content.js)
- Both `doPrint()` and `triggerWalkIn()` now include `awanaShares: <csvBalance + 1>` in the payload when Store mode is active and the kid is found in the cache. The `+ 1` reflects tonight's attendance share (the CSV is last week's total).
- Kids missing from all 5 CSVs send no `awanaShares` field — per spec, the label shows no badge rather than implying a balance the kid doesn't have.

### Server-side rendering (print-server/server.js)
- `generateLabel(...)` accepts a new optional final parameter `awanaShares = null`. Non-finite or negative values are coerced to `null` so a malformed payload can't print "🪙 -3".
- The existing bottom-right icon row branch now triggers on `(hasAllergy || isBirthday || awanaShares != null)` and prepends the shares glyph as the leftmost entry: read order is `🪙 N → 🍰 → allergy emojis`. The existing emoji font stack (`Segoe UI Emoji`, …, `sans-serif`) handles both the coin glyph and the ASCII digits.
- `/print` and `/label` accept and pass-through `awanaShares` from the request body.
- Composes cleanly with Step Up Night: a stepping-up kid on a Store night gets the inverted black/amber label AND the `🪙 N` badge.

### Scope
- Chrome extension + print server. The Electron HTML renderer (`electron-app/`) is unchanged. Reprint/preview/diagnostic paths intentionally don't carry `awanaShares` (they'd need access to the share cache too, and reprints from history are contextual).

### Things to watch
- CSV fetch needs an active TwoTimTwo session. If it isn't, all 5 fetches return HTML; we detect this and skip silently — labels just won't have badges. The widget hint will say "loading…" indefinitely in that case.
- The `+1` rule is a fixed assumption per the requirement; if a kid missed last week and the office hasn't reconciled, the printed number could be off by one. Not trying to be clever about it.

## [3.5.0] - 2026-05-03
Step Up Night support: kids who are graduating to a different club next year get an inverted, hard-to-miss label that says "Stepping up to <next club>" in place of their handbook group.

### Why
This Wednesday is Step Up Night at KVBC. Volunteers need to be able to spot stepping-up kids at a glance so they're routed to the right room — same name, same allergy/birthday icons, but a label that visually screams "this kid is changing clubs".

### Detection (chrome-extension/content.js, options.html / options.js)
- New `isStepUpNight()` scans the TwoTimTwo page DOM (excluding the widget) for any heading or event/title element whose visible text contains "step up" (case-insensitive).
- New widget toggle (Auto / On / Off) sits next to Quick Mode. The hint shows the live auto-detect result so volunteers can see what the page reports.
- Same toggle is also surfaced on the extension Options page; the two stay in sync via `chrome.storage.local` and the `chrome.storage.onChanged` listener in the content script.
- The current mode is included on every `/print` and `/label` payload as `stepUpNight: true|false`.

### Eligibility (print-server/server.js)
- New `isSteppingUp(record, clubName)` decides whether a given kid actually graduates next year:
  - **Puggles:** all of them step up to Cubbies.
  - **Cubbies:** the kid's 5th birthday must fall on or before October 15 of the next Awana-year start (the script automatically uses this calendar year's Oct 15 if today is January–June, next year's Oct 15 otherwise).
  - **Sparks:** 2nd-graders step up to T&T.
  - **T&T:** 5th-graders step up to Trek.
  - **Trek:** 8th-graders step up to Journey.
  - **Journey:** 12th-graders step up to Graduates.
- Helpers added: `parseBirthdate` (handles both `MM/DD/YYYY` and `YYYY-MM-DD`), `parseGrade` (`K`/`Kindergarten` → 0, `1st` → 1, …, `12th` → 12; rejects Pre-K), `clubKey`, `nextClubFor`, plus the `STEP_UP_GRADUATING_GRADE` and `STEP_UP_NEXT_CLUB` constants for easy adjustment.
- `/print` and `/label` only honour the client's `stepUpNight` flag for kids who actually pass `isSteppingUp()`. Everyone else prints a normal label tonight.

### Inverted label rendering (print-server/server.js — `generateLabel`)
- Stepping-up labels render on a black background with white name, light-gray supporting text, and an amber "Stepping up to <next club>" line replacing the handbook-group line. The visitor pill inverts to white-on-black so it stays readable.
- The current club's icon panel is dropped on stepping-up labels (the kid is leaving that club; widening the text area also makes the message more prominent).
- All previously-existing label features (allergy emojis, birthday cake, visitor pill, club font personality, etc.) still render — the change is a pure color/text-content swap.

### Scope
- Chrome extension + print server. The Electron HTML renderer (`electron-app/`) is unchanged.

## [3.0.4] - 2026-05-03
Belt-and-suspenders pass after the v3.0.3 fixes: close the last two paths that could produce errant labels and make batch check-in self-verify so kids can't be left as "label printed but not actually checked in".

### Why
A full audit of every print trigger and the batch check-in chain found two remaining gaps:
- **Stale offline queue could replay a label.** `flushQueue()` reads from `localStorage` (persists across crashes / restarts) but never consulted `printedNames` before `POST /print`. If a kid was queued during a server outage, then printed via another path (onCheckin / roster diff / Pusher) before the queue flushed, the queue would re-print them.
- **Batch check-in clicked the modal button but never confirmed TwoTimTwo accepted it.** With v3.0.3's fresh-element re-query, `.click()` reliably opens the modal and the modal button gets clicked — but if TwoTimTwo dismissed the modal without recording the check-in (modal race, network blip), the chain proceeded to the next sibling regardless. The label was already printed but the kid was left visible in the roster.

### Fixes (chrome-extension/content.js)
- **Queue-flush dedup:** `flushQueue()` now checks `printedNames` before sending each queued item; already-printed entries are dropped. Successful flushes also call `markPrinted()` so a later path won't re-emit them.
- **Self-verifying batch check-in:** new `verifyBatchCheckin()` polls the `.clubber` roster for up to 2 s after the modal click; if the kid's row is still present, it re-clicks the row and re-runs `pollForCheckinButton` once before logging and moving on. `pollForCheckinButton()` got a matching `retriesLeft` parameter and now also re-clicks the row once if the modal never opened (button never appeared inside its 3 s window). Existing single-call sites (Quick Mode, search-triggered check-in) inherit the verification automatically.

### Scope
- **Chrome extension only.** No server changes.

## [3.0.3] - 2026-04-30
Two volunteer-reported bugs from the live event: phantom labels printing during page searches, and batch sibling check-in printing labels but not actually checking the kids in on TwoTimTwo.

### Why
- **Phantom prints during search.** Prior phantom-print fixes (v2.3.0 mass-disappearance guard, v3.0.2.3 server-side dedup) reduced but didn't eliminate it. Two gaps remained:
  - `watchCheckins()` was calling `scanClubberList()` from inside the MutationObserver callback. Each search keystroke fires DOM mutations; with `PENDING_MISS_THRESHOLD = 2`, a kid hidden during typing could hit two consecutive misses inside ~200 ms instead of the documented ≥10 s.
  - The mass-disappearance guard required `missingCount > 3` strict-greater. A 7-kid club with 3 hidden by search produces exactly 3 — guard skips, consecutive-miss confirmation fires, label phantom-prints.
- **Batch siblings printed but not checked in.** `batchCheckInSiblings()` clicked `sib.element` — a DOM reference captured at `findSiblings()` time. After the first sibling's check-in, TwoTimTwo re-renders the roster, the cached node detaches, and `.click()` on a detached node is a silent no-op. The print succeeded (it only needs cached name/club), but the modal never opened so `pollForCheckinButton()` had nothing to click.

### Fixes (chrome-extension/content.js)
- **Pause roster-diff during search:** new `isSearchActive()` helper checks for any visible non-widget text/search input with non-empty value. `scanClubberList()` now returns early and clears `pendingMissing` when search is active.
- **Drop mutation-driven scan:** `watchCheckins()` no longer calls `scanClubberList()` from the `MutationObserver` callback. The 5-second `setInterval` and the once-on-init scan remain — remote check-in detection latency is unchanged from documented behaviour.
- **Tightened Guard A:** `MASS_DISAPPEAR_ABS` lowered from 3 to 1. Combined with the unchanged `<80%` ratio, this catches the small-roster gap (7-kid club with 3 hidden) without touching legitimate single check-ins (a 50-kid roster never crosses 80% from one kid disappearing).
- **Fresh DOM lookup before batch click:** new `findClubberElByName()` re-queries the live `.clubber` row by name. `batchCheckInSiblings()` now resolves a fresh element immediately before `.click()` and skips to the next sibling if the row is gone.

### Scope
- **Chrome extension only.** `print-server/` and `electron-app/` are unchanged.

## [3.0.2.4] - 2026-04-29
Added extension settings page for Pusher configuration.

### Added (chrome-extension/)
- **Options Page:** New settings page (`options.html` / `options.js`) accessible via right-click → "Options" on the extension icon, or via the new "Extension Settings" button in the popup.
- **Pusher Fields:** App ID, Key, Secret, and Cluster inputs that load from and save to the print server's `/config` endpoint.
- **Offline Handling:** Settings page shows a warning banner when the print server is unreachable, but remains usable.

## [3.0.2.3] - 2026-04-18
Fixed duplicate prints and server responsiveness issues.

### Fixes (print-server/server.js)
- **Asynchronous Printing:** Refactored printImage and printer diagnostics to use non-blocking asynchronous execution. This prevents the server from appearing 'offline' in the dashboard during active printing.
- **Server-Side Deduplication:** Implemented a 4-hour cooldown for reprinting the same name. This prevents 'phantom' prints even if the client triggers multiple requests.

### Fixes (chrome-extension/content.js)
- **Session Persistence:** Updated printedNames deduplication set to reliably persist in sessionStorage. This ensures that children already printed during a session remain marked as 'printed' even after the page auto-refreshes or is manually reloaded.

## [3.0.2.2] - 2026-04-17
Fixes Quick Mode auto-sibling check-in.

### Fixes (chrome-extension/content.js)
- **Quick Mode Auto-Siblings:** Fixed an issue where clicking a child''s name in Quick Mode would skip the sibling check-in logic. Sibling detection and automatic check-in is now integrated directly into the Quick Mode click interceptor.

## [3.0.2.1] - 2026-04-17
Hotfix for print server crash and configuration improvements.

### Fixes (print-server/server.js)
- **Fix crash on print:** Added null check for `pusher` object. The server would previously crash if Pusher was not configured (default state).
- **Fix SyntaxError:** Removed redundant `CONFIG_FILE` declaration that prevented the server from starting.

### Setup (install-and-run.ps1, print-server/public/index.html)
- **Pusher Configuration:** Added UI and script prompts to configure Pusher App ID, Key, Secret, and Cluster. Credentials are saved to `config.json` and persist across restarts.
- **Improved Settings Dashboard:** Settings panel now includes a dedicated Pusher section with helpful hints.

## [3.0.1] - 2026-04-17
Broadcast real-time check-in events via Pusher so external dashboards/displays can react instantly. After each successful print, `print-server/server.js` triggers a `checkin` event on `awana-channel` with `firstName`, `club`, `isBirthday`, and `isFirstTimer`. Pusher is initialised with placeholder credentials (appId/key/secret/cluster) that must be replaced before use. Added `pusher` npm dependency.

## [3.0.0] - 2026-04-16
"Go Big" release: 14 improvements to reduce clicks, add automation, and simplify setup. The #1 volunteer complaint was "too many buttons to click" â€” Quick Mode addresses this directly.

### Quick Mode (chrome-extension/content.js)
- **One-click check-in:** New "Quick Mode" toggle in the widget. When ON, clicking a child's name immediately prints their label and auto-dismisses the check-in modal (skips Bible/Friend options). Visual cue: panel header turns blue.
- **Auto-sibling check-in:** In Quick Mode, siblings are automatically checked in without showing the confirmation popup. Uses the existing `batchCheckInSiblings()` path.
- **Keyboard-driven check-in:** Arrow keys navigate search results, Enter checks in the selected child, Escape clears.

### Search-First UI (chrome-extension/content.js)
- **Roster search bar** at the top of the widget with type-ahead filtering. Matches against the cached roster (refreshed every 5s by `scanClubberList()`).
- Up to 8 results shown in a dropdown. Click or press Enter to check in. In Quick Mode, prints immediately; otherwise opens TwoTimTwo's native modal.
- DOM element references now cached in `ROSTER_CACHE` alongside club info, enabling click-to-check-in from search results.

### Automation (chrome-extension/content.js, print-server/server.js, scripts)
- **Auto-start on boot:** Install script now offers to add a shortcut to the Windows Startup folder (opt-in, idempotent).
- **Stale CSV warning:** Yellow banner appears in the widget when the server's `/health` endpoint reports `csvStale`, `csvMissing`, or `csvEmpty`. Click to refresh.
- **Auto-retry failed prints:** `doPrint()` now retries once after 3 seconds before queuing. Handles transient server hiccups.
- **Non-blocking update notice:** Widget now shows "Server update vX available â€” restart server to apply" when the server detects a newer version on GitHub.
- **Self-healing server:** `launch-awana.bat` now runs a restart loop (max 5 restarts per Zero-Loop Policy) instead of a fire-and-forget `start /min`. Server runs in the foreground of the "Keep this window open" window.

### Setup Simplification (chrome-extension/content.js, print-server/server.js, install-and-run.ps1)
- **Auto-detect printer:** If only one printer is connected, it's auto-selected in both the install script and the Chrome extension (via new `autoDetected` field in `/printers` response).
- **Chrome extension auto-config:** Printer selection is now persisted in `chrome.storage.local` (survives extension updates), with `localStorage` fallback.
- **Pre-warm printer:** Optional `config.json` setting (`prewarmPrinter: true`) sends a blank label to the printer 5 seconds after server start, eliminating cold-start delay. Off by default.

### Dashboard & UX (print-server/public/index.html, chrome-extension/content.js)
- **Traffic-light health dashboard:** Large green/yellow/red indicator at the top of the server dashboard (localhost:3456). Plain-English warning descriptions instead of technical codes. Auto-refreshes every 10 seconds (was 30s).
- **"Help â€” Not Working?" panic button:** Orange button at the bottom of the widget. Runs `/diagnostics`, parses the 4 test results, and shows plain-English guidance (printer off, server unreachable, roster missing, etc.).
- **Periodic health checks:** Extension now re-checks `/health` every 60 seconds to surface warnings promptly.

## [2.3.0] - 2026-04-15
Fix phantom prints caused by the roster-diff remote check-in detector, and replace the "Happy Birthday!" text banner with a ðŸ° cake emoji in the bottom-right icon row.

### Why
Two live-event bugs:
- **Genevieve Bean** printed a label even though she was never checked in.
- **Eowyn Bambakakis** printed **twice** even though she was never checked in.

Both are the same root cause. `scanClubberList()` treats any `.clubber` row that was present in the previous scan but missing in the current one as a remote check-in. But `.clubber` rows can disappear for reasons that are **not** check-ins: search/filter input, club-tab filtering, scroll virtualization, or a page reload that restores `knownClubbers` from `sessionStorage` while the filter state is now different. When that happens, the diff mass-prints the "missing" kids. If the filter flaps twice (or a reload lands in a different filter state), the same phantom can print twice because `printedNames` dedup never records a real print target between the flaps.

### Phantom-print fix (chrome-extension/content.js)
- **Mass-disappearance guard:** if > 3 kids go missing in a single scan **and** the roster shrinks below 80% of its previous size, treat it as a UI reshuffle (filter / tab switch / reload) and re-baseline `knownClubbers` without printing anyone. Clears `pendingMissing` to prevent stale state.
- **Consecutive-miss confirmation:** a new `pendingMissing` `Map<nameKey, missCount>` requires a kid to be absent for **2 consecutive scans** (â‰¥ 10 seconds at the 5-second `SCAN_INTERVAL_MS`) before the diff path fires. A single-scan flap (brief filter, virtualization glitch) clears pending state as soon as the kid reappears in `current`.
- The scan iterates the union of `knownClubbers` + `pendingMissing.keys()` so in-flight pending entries continue to be re-evaluated after `knownClubbers` rolls forward to the latest scan.
- The `#lastCheckin` observer path is unchanged â€” it remains the trusted primary detector for check-ins made on this browser.

### Birthday cake emoji (print-server/server.js)
- Removed the red 9pt bold "Happy Birthday!" text banner that used to sit under the handbook group (and its contribution to `blockH`, so the centered text block is now truly centered on non-birthday labels as well).
- Added a ðŸ° glyph at **26pt** (~1.6Ã— the 16pt allergy emoji size) to the bottom-right icon row. Rendered with the same emoji font stack as the allergy emojis (`"Segoe UI Emoji", "Apple Color Emoji", "Noto Color Emoji", sans-serif`) so visual style matches.
- Ordering in the row: **cake leftmost, allergy emojis to its right**, with the rightmost allergy emoji anchored against the label's right padding. The icon row renders whenever `hasAllergy || isBirthday`.
- Per-glyph measurement via `ctx.measureText` so the differently-sized cake and allergy emojis share the same baseline and pack cleanly without overlap.

### Scope
- **Chrome extension + print server only.** The Electron HTML label renderer (`electron-app/src/server.js`) already did not render allergies or birthdays, so it is unchanged.

## [2.2.0] - 2026-04-09
Detect remote check-ins by diffing the `.clubber` roster across scans, so a kid checked in from another device (phone, second laptop) eventually gets their label printed here. Auto-refresh the page during peak time so the diff sees fresh data.

### Why
TwoTimTwo.com doesn't push real-time updates â€” the existing `#lastCheckin` observer only fires for check-ins made on *this* browser. If a volunteer uses a phone or a second laptop to check someone in, the label never prints because the laptop never sees the event. This was causing missed labels during the 5:40â€“6:00 PM rush when multiple volunteers are checking kids in simultaneously.

### Remote check-in detection (chrome-extension/content.js)
- New `scanClubberList()` captures the visible `.clubber` names on every scan; any name present on the previous scan but missing now is treated as a check-in (local *or* remote) and its label is printed via the normal `doPrint()` path.
- Club name + icon image are cached in `ROSTER_CACHE` while the kid is still visible, so they can still be printed after the kid disappears (where `lookupClub()` would fail).
- A session-scoped `printedNames` `Set` dedupes across the `#lastCheckin` path, the batch-sibling path, and the new diff path â€” a locally-checked-in kid is never reprinted. `onCheckin()` and `batchCheckInSiblings()` now call `markPrinted()` to feed this set.
- State (`printedNames`, `knownClubbers`, `ROSTER_CACHE`, baseline flag) is persisted to `sessionStorage` so detection survives the peak-window auto-refresh reload. A 4-hour idle timeout auto-clears the dedup state between Awana nights.
- First scan after load is a baseline-only populate â€” we never print the full roster on page load.
- Scans fire once on init, on every debounced `MutationObserver` callback, and on a 5-second safety interval.

### Peak-window auto-refresh (chrome-extension/content.js)
- New `autoRefresh()` reloads the page every 30 seconds when the local clock is between 17:40 and 18:00.
- Suppressed when the document is hidden, the sibling panel (`#awana-sibling-panel`) is open, the check-in modal (`#checkin-modal`) is open, or any `INPUT`/`TEXTAREA`/`SELECT` is focused â€” preserves in-progress user actions.

### Scope
- **Chrome extension only** â€” `electron-app/src/checkin-script.js` intentionally not updated in this release.

## [2.1.0] - 2026-04-09
Batch check-in reliability and quality improvements: duplicate prevention, faster throughput, club-specific fonts, age-appropriate sibling options, and correct multi-family separation.

### Improvements

**Duplicate label prevention (batch check-in):**
- `lastPrintTime` is now updated when batch fires a print, engaging the `PRINT_COOLDOWN` guard as a second layer alongside the existing `batchPrintedNames` Set.
- Name keys stored in `batchPrintedNames` are now `.trim()`ed for both write and read, eliminating any edge-case mismatch from trailing whitespace in `#lastCheckin`.

**Faster batch check-ins:**
- `BATCH_DELAY` reduced from 700 ms to 400 ms between siblings. The print fires before the check-in modal is submitted so the modal round-trip is the real bottleneck â€” 400 ms is sufficient for the next sibling selection without sacrificing reliability.

**Club-specific label fonts:**
- Each Awana club now uses a distinct font personality on the printed label:
  - Puggles / Cubbies â†’ Comic Sans MS (fun, rounded, age-appropriate)
  - Sparks â†’ Trebuchet MS (modern, energetic)
  - T&T â†’ Arial Black (bold, strong)
  - Trek â†’ Georgia (classic, mature)
  - Journey â†’ Palatino Linotype (sophisticated)
  - Unknown / default â†’ Helvetica / Arial (unchanged)
- `fitFontSize` updated to accept a `fontFamily` parameter so auto-sizing uses the same face as rendering.

**No Bible / Friend options for Puggles and Cubbies:**
- Sibling check-in panel now detects the sibling's club name. If the club is Puggles or Cubbies the Bible and Friend checkboxes are omitted â€” those programmes don't track those options.

**Correct Miller-family (same-last-name) separation:**
- `findSiblings` previously always fell back to DOM last-name matching when the server returned zero siblings, incorrectly grouping unrelated families who share a last name.
- Fix: if the server responds successfully (HTTP 200) with an empty siblings list the DOM fallback is suppressed. The fallback now only activates when the server is unreachable or times out.
- Families with the same last name are correctly separated as long as the synced CSV contains any distinguishing field: HouseholdID, PrimaryContact, Guardian, or Address.

## [2.0.5] - 2026-04-08
Critical fixes for sibling check-in â€” all siblings were timing out due to four bugs in button detection and options application.

### Bug Fixes (pollForCheckinButton)

**Bug 1 â€” offsetParent always null for position:fixed elements:**
- `#checkin-modal` uses CSS `position: fixed`, which means `offsetParent` is **always `null`** regardless of visibility. Strategy 1 was never finding the button because the visibility check failed immediately.
- **Fix:** Replace `ttModal.offsetParent !== null` with `window.getComputedStyle(ttModal).display !== 'none'`.

**Bug 2 â€” Wrong modalContainer from `.closest('[class*="modal"]')`:**
- `.closest()` walks up the DOM and stops at the first ancestor matching the selector. For `button#checkin`, it matched `.modal-footer` (an ancestor whose class name contains "modal"), not `#checkin-modal`. Result: 0 checkboxes found, Bible/Friend options never applied.
- **Fix:** Use `document.getElementById('checkin-modal')` directly instead of `.closest()`.

**Bug 3 â€” Double-submission from dual click handlers:**
- Code called both `checkinBtn.click()` and `checkinBtn.dispatchEvent(new MouseEvent('click'))`, firing the form submission handler twice and creating duplicate check-in records.
- **Fix:** Remove the `dispatchEvent` line. `.click()` alone is sufficient.

**Bug 4 â€” Broken timeout fallback calls immediately:**
- `setTimeout(batchCheckInSiblings(remaining), BATCH_DELAY)` executed `batchCheckInSiblings(remaining)` right away (passing `undefined` to `setTimeout`). The deferred batch never ran.
- **Fix:** Wrap in a function: `setTimeout(function() { batchCheckInSiblings(remaining); }, BATCH_DELAY)`.

**Bonus â€” Strategy 4 selector specificity:**
- Changed from `.modal button` to `#checkin-modal button` to avoid accidentally matching buttons in other Bootstrap modals on the page (like `#page-info-window`).

**Result:** Siblings now check in correctly with Bible/Friend options applied and no duplicate submissions.

## [2.0.4] - 2026-04-08
Removes bookmarklet, consolidates on Chrome extension only.

### Bookmarklet Removed
- **Decision:** Eliminated `bookmarklet.js` and related files (root + `print-server/public/`). All functionality now lives exclusively in the Chrome extension (`chrome-extension/content.js`).
- **Why:** Bookmarklet requires manual paste into browser console on every visit; Chrome extension persists and auto-injects. Extension is the single source of truth going forward.
- **Updated:** `vite.config.ts` no longer serves/emits bookmarklet files. Removed `package.json` bookmarklet scripts and deleted `scripts/validate-bookmarklet.cjs` and `scripts/build-bookmarklet-url.cjs`.

### Chrome Extension Updated (v2.0.3 fixes)
- Applied sibling check-in fixes to `chrome-extension/content.js`: Strategy 1 now targets `button#checkin` in visible `#checkin-modal`.
- Per-sibling Bible/Friend checkboxes in the sibling panel (no global options).
- Faster batch check-ins: `BATCH_DELAY` 700ms, prints fire in background before check-in.
- `batchPrintedNames` deduplication to prevent double-prints from `#lastCheckin` observer.

## [2.0.3] - 2026-04-08
Fixes sibling batch check-in, speeds up batch processing, and updates checkbox UI.

### Sibling Check-in Fix
- **Root cause fixed:** `pollForCheckinButton` Strategy 1 now directly targets `button#checkin` inside `#checkin-modal` when that modal is visible. TwoTimTwo's Bootstrap modal is pre-rendered in the DOM (always present but hidden), so the previous "new button" detection (Strategy 2) always skipped it since it was in the pre-click snapshot. Now we check modal visibility (`offsetParent !== null`) before querying the button.
- **Strategy 2 simplified:** No longer relies on pre-click button snapshot â€” now simply scans all visible buttons for check-in text, which correctly handles both React (dynamic) and Bootstrap (static) modal patterns.
- **Strategy 3 hardened:** Added visibility check (`offsetParent !== null`) before matching by text, preventing false positives from hidden modals.

### Faster Batch Check-ins
- **Print queued in background:** `batchCheckInSiblings` now fires `doPrint` for each sibling immediately before clicking their card, so label printing happens in the background while check-ins proceed.
- **Reduced inter-sibling delay:** `PRINT_COOLDOWN + 500` (2500ms) â†’ `BATCH_DELAY` (700ms) between siblings. Entire batch of 3 siblings now takes ~2s instead of ~7.5s.
- **Deduplication guard:** Added `batchPrintedNames` Set. When `#lastCheckin div` updates after a batch check-in, `onCheckin` checks this set and skips printing to prevent double-prints. Names are cleared from the set after 8 seconds.

### Sibling Panel UI
- **Per-child checkboxes:** Each sibling row now shows Bible (default checked) and Friend (default unchecked) checkboxes on the right, instead of a global "Check-in Options" section at the bottom.
- **Removed global options:** Bible, Book, and Uniform global checkboxes replaced by per-sibling Bible and Friend options.
- **`applyCheckinOptions` updated:** Now maps Bible â†’ `/bible/i` and Friend â†’ `/friend|brought/i` (removed Book and Uniform patterns).

### Simulator CheckinModal
- **Checkboxes repositioned:** Bible and Friend checkboxes now appear to the right of the child's name/info in the modal header, not in a separate body section below.
- **Simplified to two options:** Removed "Kids Club meeting" checkbox. Only Bible (default checked) and Friend (default unchecked) remain.
- **Bookmarklet-compatible IDs:** Modal container now has `id="checkin-modal"` and Checkin button has `id="checkin"` so bookmarklet Strategy 1 works in the simulator.

## [2.0.2] - 2026-04-06
Critical fixes for batch check-in and print dialog consistency.

### Batch Check-in Button Detection
- **Multi-strategy search:** `pollForCheckinButton()` now uses three fallback strategies: explicit TwoTimTwo selectors (`.checkin-btn`, `[data-action="checkin"]`), pre-click button snapshot to find newly-appeared modal buttons (eliminates reliance on specific CSS classes), and modal-scoped selector fallback. Resolves batch check-in failures on different TwoTimTwo UI versions.
- **Pre-click snapshot:** `batchCheckInSiblings()` now snapshots all visible buttons before clicking a clubber card. The subsequent poll can identify the new check-in button even if TwoTimTwo wraps it in dynamically-generated containers.

### Print Dialog Consistency
- **Unified label rendering:** New `/label` POST endpoint generates the same PNG label that `/print` would send silently, without printing it. This ensures Print Dialog mode uses the identical canvas output (with allergies, birthday banner, handbook group, visitor badge, enrichment) instead of hand-coded HTML that was missing club name and enrichment data.
- **Fallback behavior:** If `/label` is unavailable (offline/error), fallback HTML now correctly includes club name and respects the offline label structure.

## [2.0.1] - 2026-04-06
Fixes race condition in batch sibling check-in, adds check-in attribute options to the sibling panel, and improves sibling detection using the synced CSV roster.

### Extension & Bookmarklet Fixes
- **Batch check-in race condition fixed:** `batchCheckInSiblings()` no longer uses a hardcoded 600 ms `setTimeout` before looking for the check-in button. It now polls every 100 ms for up to 3 seconds, checking button visibility (`offsetParent !== null`) before clicking â€” eliminating failures on slower connections or React/Vue SPA pages where the modal renders asynchronously.
- **Dual-click for framework compatibility:** Once the check-in button is found, both `.click()` and a bubbling `MouseEvent('click')` are dispatched so React/Vue synthetic event handlers are reliably triggered.
- **Check-in Options in sibling panel:** The sibling sidebar now includes a "Check-in Options" section with Bible, Book, and Uniform checkboxes (unchecked by default). Checked options are applied to the modal's corresponding checkboxes (with `change` + `click` events) before the check-in form is submitted.
- **CSV-based sibling detection:** `findSiblings()` is now async and first queries the new server `/siblings` endpoint before falling back to the existing DOM last-name match. This finds siblings in blended families or families where children have different last names, as long as the roster CSV includes a common family identifier (Household ID, Primary Contact, Guardian, or Address).

### Server Changes
- **`GET /siblings?name=First+Last`:** New endpoint returns an array of sibling names for the given child, derived from the synced `clubbers.csv`. Groups families by the best available identifier (HouseholdID â†’ PrimaryContact â†’ Guardian â†’ Address â†’ LastName fallback). Returns `{ siblings: [] }` if the child is not in the CSV or has no detected family members.
- **Extended CSV column support:** `HEADER_MAP` now recognises family/household identifier columns exported by TwoTimTwo and similar systems: `Primary Contact`, `Guardian`, `Parents`, `Household ID`, `Family ID`, `Address`, and common variants.

## [2.0.0] - 2026-04-06
Major release adding dashboard, sibling batch check-in, offline queue, and operational tooling.

### Server Features
- **Dashboard Web UI:** Open `localhost:3456` for real-time server status, print history, label preview, settings, and diagnostics â€” all in one page.
- **Label Preview Endpoint:** `GET /preview?name=Alice+Smith` returns a rendered PNG without printing. Used by dashboard and useful for testing.
- **Print History:** Every print is logged to `print-history.json`. View today's prints on the dashboard with one-click reprint buttons.
- **Reprint Endpoint:** `POST /reprint` reprints any label from history without re-checking-in the child.
- **Enhanced Health Checks:** `/health` now returns warnings (printer not found, CSV missing/empty/stale) surfaced on the dashboard and in the extension widget.
- **Auto-Update Check:** Server checks GitHub for newer versions on startup and every 6 hours. Update notice shown on dashboard and extension.
- **Config via Web UI:** Change printer and check-in URL from the dashboard Settings tab (saves to config.json).
- **Self-Diagnostics:** One-click diagnostic tool checks server, printer, CSV, and label rendering with pass/fail indicators.
- **Visitor Badge:** Walk-in guests flagged as visitors get a "VISITOR" badge in the top-right corner of their label.

### Extension & Bookmarklet Features
- **Sibling Batch Check-in:** When a child checks in, the extension detects siblings (same last name) and shows a popup with checkboxes to check them all in with one click.
- **Audio Feedback:** Success chime on print, error tone on failure. Mute toggle in the widget.
- **Offline Print Queue:** When the server is unreachable, labels queue in localStorage (up to 50) and auto-flush when connectivity restores.
- **Walk-in Guest Enhancement:** Club selector dropdown and "Visitor" checkbox added to the walk-in guest section. Visitors get a badge on their label.

### Simulator
- **Sibling Test Data:** Added Simpson and Johnson sibling pairs to mock data for testing the batch check-in feature.
- **v2.0 Feature Tiles:** PrintServerInfo component updated with new feature descriptions.

## [1.10.9] - 2026-04-04
- **Widget Default Minimized:** Widget now starts collapsed as a small green pill instead of an expanded panel. Prevents the widget from obstructing page content on first load. Click the pill to expand; click Ã— to collapse again. State persists across page loads.

## [1.10.8] - 2026-04-04
- **Widget Position Fix:** Reverted inline DOM injection (placed widget in wrong sidebar). Widget now uses `position: fixed` at `top: 55px, right: 12px` â€” floating over the right column below the site nav bars.

## [1.10.7] - 2026-04-04
- **Widget Position Fix:** Widget now inserts to the RIGHT of `#lastCheckin` (was incorrectly inserting to the left).

## [1.10.6] - 2026-04-04
- **Embedded Widget:** Widget now injects inline beside the `#lastCheckin` element instead of floating as a fixed overlay, using the page's existing whitespace.
- **Green Color Scheme:** Replaced purple with the site's green (`#4caf50`) on the pill, panel header, and Walk-in Print button.
- **Softer Panel Style:** Lighter border (`#c8e6c9`), reduced shadow, and `8px` border radius to blend with the site's flat design.
- **Fallback:** If `#lastCheckin` is not found, widget still appears as a fixed top-right overlay.

## [1.10.5] - 2026-04-04
- **Label Border Removed:** Removed the black rounded-rect outline surrounding the label.
- **Larger Club Logo:** Increased club logo max size from 56pt to 76pt (aspect ratio preserved via letterboxing).

## [1.10.4] - 2026-04-04
- **Allergy Icons Redesign:** Removed red bottom bar. Allergy icons now appear in the lower-right corner of the label. Icons are larger (16pt vs 13pt).
- **Removed Shellfish:** Dropped SHELLFISH (ðŸ¦) from allergy detection and icon map.
- **DYE Icon:** Changed from âš  to ðŸ’§ (water drop) for food dye/artificial coloring sensitivity.

## [1.10.3] - 2026-04-04
- **Aspect Ratio Fix:** Club logo images were squished to 64Ã—64 square before being sent to the print server. Fixed `getClubImageDataUrl()` in both content.js and bookmarklet.js to letterbox images preserving natural aspect ratio.
- **HandbookGroup Filter:** Children in handbook group "All" (case-insensitive) now print no group text â€” the field is treated as blank.
- **Walk-in Guest Print:** Added free-text input to extension widget. Type any name and press Print/Enter to print a basic label for walk-in guests not in the TwoTimTwo roster.

## [1.10.2] - 2026-03-30
- **Orientation Fix:** Replaced landscape flag with explicit `PaperSize("Label", 400, 200)` (4"Ã—2" in hundredths of inches). D450 label stock was being rotated 90Â° extra, producing portrait output.
- **Emoji Allergy Icons:** Replaced text strip ("NUTS â€¢ DAIRY") with emojis (ðŸ¥œðŸ¥›ðŸŒ¾ðŸ¥šðŸ¦âš ) using Segoe UI Emoji font, increased from 14pt to 20pt.

## [1.10.1] - 2026-03-30
- **Silent Print Fix:** Fixed blank page submissions. Root cause: `$img` in outer scope was inaccessible in `add_PrintPage` event handler (known .NET closure issue). Now store image path as `PrintDocument` property, load fresh inside handler via `$sender.LabelImagePath`. Script written to temp file with `-File` flag to avoid multiline quoting issues. Added `$ErrorActionPreference = 'Stop'` for real error surfacing.

## [1.10.0] - 2026-03-30
- **Printer Selection:** Added dropdown to extension widget. Fetches `GET /printers`, stores selection in localStorage, sends with every print request. "Server Default" falls back to `PRINTER_NAME` env var.
- **New `/printers` endpoint:** Returns installed printers and server default.
- **Per-request override:** `/print` endpoint accepts optional `printerName` in POST body.

## [1.9.3] - 2026-03-30
- **Extension Autoprint Fix:** Content script routed through background service worker, which can terminate mid-flight. Now fetches print server directly (matching bookmarklet).

## [1.9.2] - 2026-03-29
- **Orientation Fix:** Set `Landscape = $true` in PowerShell for 4x2 aspect ratio.
- **Electron Sync:** Updated Electron print server to PNG engine for consistency.

## [1.9.1] - 2026-03-29
- **PNG Engine:** Replaced PDF (pdfkit + pdf-to-printer) with PNG (canvas + PowerShell System.Drawing). 1200x600 pixels at 300 DPI eliminates driver rotation issues. Tested on Labelife D450 BT.
- **Widget UX:** Minimize button â†’ arrow tab on left edge. Full collapse when minimized.
- **Dependency change:** pdfkit/pdf-to-printer â†’ canvas.

## [1.9.0] - 2026-03-29
- **Orientation (real fix):** PDF page 4"x2" portrait, passing `orientation: 'portrait'` and `scale: 'noscale'` to pdf-to-printer to prevent driver rotation.

## [1.8.9] - 2026-03-29
- **Version Check:** Secondary check compares project `VERSION` against script version. Catches stale project zips (including chrome-extension/) even when `.script-version` matches.

## [1.8.8] - 2026-03-29
- **Install Location Migration:** Moved from `%APPDATA%\Awana-Print` to `C:\output`. Detects old location, migrates config.json + clubbers.csv, removes old folder.
- **ProgressPreference Fix:** Single global assignment at top of install-and-run.ps1, removed individual assignments that error in some contexts.

## [1.8.7] - 2026-03-29
- **Launcher Path Fix:** launch-awana.bat now derives install dir from own location (`%~dp0`) instead of hardcoding. Desktop shortcut works anywhere.
- **Update Fix:** Launcher downloads install-and-run.ps1 directly, passes `-InstallPath` matching current location.

## [1.8.6] - 2026-03-29
- **Installer Fix:** Removed `$ProgressPreference` from bootstrap install.ps1 (double-quoted `-Command` interpolates `$` variables). Changed one-liner to single quotes.

## [1.8.5] - 2026-03-29
- **Widget Minimize:** Added collapse/expand button to print widget.
- **Widget Version Display:** Shows current extension version (e.g. "v1.8.5").
- **Extension Auto-Update:** Checks `/health` endpoint for version mismatches, displays "Update available" notice.
- **Server Health Endpoint:** `/health` now returns `version` alongside `status` and `printer`.
- **Version Sync:** `bump-version.cjs` updates chrome-extension files automatically.
