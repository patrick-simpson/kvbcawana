# Troubleshooting Guide

Having issues with Club Label Printer? This guide covers common problems and solutions.

## Windows App (.exe) Issues

### "Windows protected your PC" (SmartScreen) when running the installer

This is Windows being cautious about a new community-built app — the installer is not signed with a
paid certificate. Click **More info**, then **Run anyway**. It only appears on first install;
after that the app updates itself silently — usually within a minute or two of a release going out,
**including mid-club-night**. That is deliberate: a release that ships while a club is running is
almost always an urgent fix, so the app downloads it, gives any in-flight label print a few seconds
to finish, and restarts itself. The print server comes back up on its own within seconds; nobody
needs to touch the laptop. If you'd rather it not surprise you, watch the tray icon — it shows
"Updating to vX… restarting" for the few seconds before it happens.

Two ways an update reaches the app, in order of speed:

1. **Push** — the release workflow pings the same Pusher channel the lobby display already uses,
   so most laptops start downloading within a minute or two of a release. This needs the
   `PUSHER_APP_ID`/`PUSHER_KEY`/`PUSHER_SECRET`/`PUSHER_CLUSTER` repo secrets (and optionally
   `PUSHER_CHANNEL`) set on the repo — see `docs/SETUP.md`.
2. **Poll** — every launch, and every 24 hours after that, regardless of push. This is what covers
   a laptop that was off or offline when the push fired, so **nothing above is required** for
   updates to work at all; push just makes them faster.

### Phones can't reach phone check-in (`http://<laptop-ip>:3456/phone`)

**Check this first (changed in 5.3.0):** the server now listens only on the
laptop itself unless you explicitly allow network access, so that the roster and
allergy list aren't readable by everything on the church Wi-Fi. Open **Settings →
Check-in Features** and confirm both:

1. A **Phone check-in PIN** is set (at least 4 characters), and
2. **"Let phones on this Wi-Fi reach this PC"** is checked.

Then **restart the app** — the listening socket is bound at startup, so the
change does not apply until it restarts.

If the PIN is missing, the checkbox has no effect: the server refuses to expose
the roster without one, logs that at startup, and shows a warning on the
dashboard. Set a PIN and restart.

Once that is right, it may still be the firewall:

1. The first time the server starts, Windows shows an **Allow access** prompt — click **Allow**.
   (Make sure "Private networks" is checked.)
2. Missed the prompt? Open the app's **Settings** (tray icon → Settings) and click
   **Enable Phone Check-in (firewall)** — approve the administrator prompt.
3. Both devices must be on the same Wi-Fi network.

### "Port 3456 is in use" dialog at startup

A previous print server is still running — usually the old script install's auto-start shortcut.
Click **Stop it and continue**. If it keeps coming back on every boot, delete
`Awana Check In.lnk` from your Startup folder
(`%APPDATA%\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup`) — the app offers to do this for you
the first time it detects an old install.

### "Server failed to start" error box

Labels cannot print in this state — the app shows the error instead of degrading silently.
Send a screenshot of the message to your administrator, or check
`%APPDATA%\awana-label-printer\` for config problems. Reinstalling the latest
release is safe: your roster and settings live in `%APPDATA%\awana-label-printer`, not in the
install folder. (That folder is still named after the app's pre-v5.9.0 name,
"Awana Label Printer" — see EXTENSION.md.)

### Where did my data go after switching from the script install?

The first run imports `config.json`, `clubbers.csv`, print history, and attendance from
`C:\output\Print-TwoTimTwo-Labels\print-server` into `%APPDATA%\awana-label-printer`. The old
folder is left untouched as a backup.

## Installation Issues (legacy PowerShell script)

### "PowerShell execution policy" error

**Error:** `cannot be loaded because running scripts is disabled on this system`

**Solution:**
1. Right-click PowerShell → **Run as Administrator**
2. Run: `Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser`
3. Type `Y` and press Enter
4. Now run `install-and-run.ps1` again

---

### "Node.js not found" even after installation

**Problem:** Node.js was installed but PATH wasn't refreshed.

**Solution:**
1. Close PowerShell completely
2. Open a **new** PowerShell window
3. Run: `node --version`
4. If still not found, reinstall Node.js from https://nodejs.org

---

### "npm install failed" or "Cannot find npm"

**Problem:** npm packages couldn't be installed.

**Solution:**
1. Check that Node.js is actually installed: `node --version`
2. Try running again - it may be a temporary network issue
3. If it fails twice, manually navigate to the print-server folder and run:
   ```powershell
   npm install
   ```

---

### "No printers found"

**Problem:** Script says no printers are detected.

**Solution:**
1. Go to **Settings → Bluetooth & devices → Printers & scanners**
2. Make sure your label printer is listed there
3. If not listed:
   - Connect the printer via USB
   - Wait 10 seconds for Windows to detect it
   - Install drivers if needed (check printer manufacturer's website)
4. Run `install-and-run.ps1` again

---

## Runtime Issues

### Labels print but look wrong

**Problem:** Labels appear cut off, text is wrong size, or formatting is broken.

**Checklist:**
1. **Verify label size:** Settings → Printers → Your Printer → Preferences → Paper size should be **4×2 inches**
2. **Check printer driver:** Some printers need specific label-size drivers
3. **Test with a manual print:** Use Windows print dialog to test one label manually
4. **Check for paper jams:** Some printers fail silently

**Solution:** Adjust label dimensions in the extension configuration (if available).

---

### Print dialog appears instead of silent print

**Problem:** Despite running the server, a print dialog still shows.

**Causes:**
1. The server might not be running
2. Printer configuration might be wrong
3. Browser might be blocking the action

**Solution:**
1. Check the PowerShell window where the server started - should say:
   ```
   Print server running at http://localhost:3456
   ```
2. If not running, look for error messages in the window
3. Verify printer name is correct (check in PowerShell output)
4. Try clicking the Test Connection button in the simulator (if you have it open)

---

### "Connection refused" or "Server not reachable"

**Problem:** Bookmarklet or test button says server can't be reached.

**Solution:**
1. Make sure `install-and-run.ps1` is still running (check PowerShell window)
2. If the window closed, run the script again
3. Check that port 3456 isn't blocked:
   ```powershell
   netstat -ano | findstr 3456
   ```
   If something is using it, either:
   - Close that application
   - Edit `install-and-run.ps1` and change line 108 from 3456 to 3457 (or another unused port)

---

### No label prints at all

**Problem:** Child checks in, but nothing happens - no print, no dialog.

**Debug steps:**
1. Open your browser's **Developer Tools (F12)**
2. Go to the **Console** tab
3. Do a check-in and look for error messages
4. Common messages:
   - `"Fetch failed"` → Server not running
   - `"Print error"` → Printer issue
   - `"POST failed"` → Network issue

**Solutions:**
- **If server not running:** Start `install-and-run.ps1` again
- **If printer error:** Check printer is online and default printer is set correctly
- **If network issue:** Make sure you're accessing TwoTimTwo from localhost or same machine

---

## Bookmarklet Issues

### Bookmarklet button doesn't appear

**Problem:** The red "AUTO PRINT" button doesn't show up on the check-in page.

**Causes:**
1. Bookmarklet wasn't installed correctly
2. You're on a different browser (bookmarklets only work in the browser where they were added)
3. JavaScript is disabled

**Solution:**
1. Go back to the Club Label Printer web simulator
2. Find the BookmarkletInfo section (red box with instructions)
3. Drag the button again to your bookmarks
4. Try clicking it on the TwoTimTwo page

---

### Bookmarklet button appears but doesn't work

**Problem:** Button shows up, but clicking it doesn't arm the auto-printer.

**Solution:**
1. Open **Developer Tools (F12)** → **Console**
2. Click the bookmarklet button
3. Look for error messages
4. If you see `"Uncaught SyntaxError"` → The bookmarklet code may be corrupted
   - Re-install by dragging the button from the web simulator again
5. If you see `"Fetch failed"` → The print server isn't running
   - Run `install-and-run.ps1` again

---

## General Debugging

### How to check server logs

The PowerShell window where you ran `install-and-run.ps1` shows all server output. Look for:
- `Printer: DYMO LabelWriter 450` → Printer is configured
- `POST /print` → Someone just tried to print
- `Error: ...` → Something went wrong

---

### How to test locally without TwoTimTwo

1. Open the React app: Run `npm run dev` in a terminal
2. You'll see a simulator with fake check-in data
3. Click "Check In" to test the bookmarklet logic
4. The Test Connection button verifies the server is running

---

### How to enable debug logging

1. Open **Developer Tools (F12)** in your browser
2. Go to **Console** tab
3. Add this to your bookmarklet or the extension to see detailed logs:
   ```javascript
   window.DEBUG_PRINT = true;
   ```
4. Then do a check-in - you'll see detailed logs in the Console

---

## Still Stuck?

If none of these solutions work:

1. **Collect information:**
   - Screenshot of the error message
   - Output from the PowerShell window
   - Browser console errors (F12 → Console tab)
   - Windows printer name (Settings → Printers & scanners)

2. **Check the GitHub issues:** https://github.com/patrick-simpson/Print-TwoTimTwo-Labels/issues
   - Your issue might already be documented

3. **Create a new issue** with the information above

## Quick Checklist

Before getting help, verify:
- [ ] Windows 10+ is running
- [ ] Node.js is installed (`node --version` works in PowerShell)
- [ ] Printer is connected and appears in Windows Settings
- [ ] Printer has paper
- [ ] install-and-run.ps1 PowerShell window is still open
- [ ] No other application is using port 3456
- [ ] Running on the TwoTimTwo.com check-in page (not a different page)

## Phone check-in problems

**Phone can't open the page** — first check Settings → Check-in Features has a
**PIN set** and **"Let phones on this Wi-Fi reach this PC"** checked, then
restart the app. Since 5.3.0 network access is off by default, so this is the
most likely cause. Next: same Wi-Fi as the laptop? Use the laptop's IPv4 from
`ipconfig`, e.g. `http://192.168.1.20:3456/phone`. If it still won't load, the
firewall rule is missing — re-run `install-and-run.ps1` once as admin (it adds
"Awana Print Server (TCP 3456)").

**Phone says "No answer"** — the check-in page must be open on the
main laptop with the extension loaded; that's what performs the real
check-in. Also check Settings → "Allow driven check-ins" is on.

**Phone shows a kid as not checked in when they are (or vice versa)** —
since 5.7.0 the phone re-fetches the roster every ~12 seconds, so
check-ins made on other devices (and undos made on TwoTimTwo) appear on
their own. If a phone seems frozen anyway, its Wi-Fi likely dropped —
the page backs off polling while unreachable and catches up as soon as
the server answers again.

**Wrong PIN** — the PIN is set on the dashboard (Settings → Check-in
Features), and must be at least 4 characters. A blank PIN no longer means
"no PIN required": it means phones cannot connect at all, because the server
will not expose the roster without one.

**"Too many wrong PINs"** — after 8 *different* wrong attempts that phone is
locked out for a minute; the page shows a live countdown and lets you back in
when it hits zero. Retyping the same wrong PIN (or mashing the button while it
sends) no longer digs the hole deeper — only distinct guesses count. (The
lockout itself is deliberate: without it a 4-digit PIN could be guessed in
seconds.)

## Red banner: "the check-in page layout has changed"

The extension's selector self-test failed — TwoTimTwo shipped new
page markup and automatic detection may be blind. Check kids in
normally; print labels via widget search or Walk-in Guest. Then check
the dashboard's Night Status card for which selector broke, and file
an issue / update the extension.
