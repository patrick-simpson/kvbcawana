# Setup guide

## 1. Print server (the main laptop)

Install the Windows app: download **Club-Label-Printer-Setup.exe**
from the [latest release](https://github.com/patrick-simpson/Print-TwoTimTwo-Labels/releases/latest),
run it (SmartScreen: *More info → Run anyway*), pick your printer and
check-in URL. The app lives in the system tray, hosts the full server
on port **3456**, starts with Windows, auto-updates, and can print a
test label from Settings. When Windows asks about network access,
click **Allow** (needed for phone check-in); or use Settings →
*Enable Phone Check-in (firewall)*.

**Updates install themselves within a minute or two of a release going
out — deliberately even mid-club-night**, since a release that ships
while a club is running is almost always an urgent fix. The app waits a
few seconds for any in-flight label print to finish, then restarts on
its own; the print server comes back up unattended. This needs no setup
to work at all (every launch, and every 24 hours after that, checks for
updates on its own) — but for it to happen within *a minute or two*
rather than up to a day, the repo needs `PUSHER_APP_ID`, `PUSHER_KEY`,
`PUSHER_SECRET` and `PUSHER_CLUSTER` set as GitHub Actions secrets (the
same Pusher app already used for the lobby display; never reuse another
church's), plus optionally `PUSHER_CHANNEL` if you changed
`pusherChannel` away from the default in `church-config.json`. Missing
any of those simply falls back to the 24-hour poll — the release step
that pings them is skipped silently, never fails the build.

Upgrading from the legacy `install-and-run.ps1` install: the app
imports your config and roster from `C:\output` on first run and
offers to remove the old shortcuts. The script path still works but
is deprecated.

## 2. Chrome extension

`chrome://extensions` → Developer mode → *Load unpacked* → pick
**`%APPDATA%\awana-label-printer\chrome-extension`**. Open the TwoTimTwo
check-in page — the green widget appears. Pin the page as the browser
homepage.

Load *that* folder, not a copy from Downloads: the app rewrites it on
every launch, so an app update also updates the extension — restart
Chrome to pick it up. The tray menu has **Open Chrome extension folder**,
and the dashboard's Diagnostics tab has a **Copy folder path** button.
Details in `EXTENSION.md`.

## 3. Dashboard settings (`http://localhost:3456`)

- **Names on the Welcome Screen** — front page, above the fold. Says
  whether children's first names are leaving this PC encrypted, with a
  button straight to the setting. If you run a lobby TV, this is the one
  to green before club night; see `SECURITY.md`.
- **Printer + check-in URL** — set once.
- **Pusher** (optional) — powers the lobby welcome display and the
  countdown app's live counts. Only this server holds the secret.
- **Realtime privacy → display key** (Settings tab) — *Generate display
  key*, **Copy**, paste the same value into every screen (their Settings
  → Connection → Display key), *then* **Save Settings**. That order means
  a mistyped paste cannot lock every screen out at once. Without a key the
  names ride a public channel in the clear.
- **Display login** (Settings tab, under the display key) — the easy way
  to set up screens: **Generate** a passphrase (it saves immediately),
  then type it once on each screen — lobby TV: Settings → Connection →
  **Display login**; projector page: Display Settings → **Log in**. The
  screen receives the display key and the slide-publish token by itself and
  keeps working when you rotate either. Needs a display key to exist and the
  print server to be running while the screen logs in. Changing the
  passphrase does **not** log screens out — each keeps the keys it holds,
  shows "log in again" in its settings, and needs the new passphrase before
  it can follow the next key rotation. Pasting the key by hand (above) still
  works under the screen's *Advanced* section.
- **Check-in Features** — phone PIN, late-arrival grace, visitor label
  style, connect cards, and the driven-check-in kill switch.
- **Group Schedule** — one row per club (start time, location, room);
  late check-ins get a "Go to:" line on the label.

## 4. Phone check-in (optional, OFF by default)

**Since 5.3.0 the server listens only on the laptop itself unless you
turn this on.** The roster, check-in history and allergy list are not
reachable from the church network by default. To enable phone check-in
you need BOTH, in Settings → Check-in Features:

1. **Phone check-in PIN** — at least 4 characters. Without a PIN the
   server refuses to expose itself and stays private (it says so at
   startup and in the dashboard's warnings).
2. **"Let phones on this Wi-Fi reach this PC"** — then restart the app,
   because the listening socket is bound at startup.

Then any phone on the same Wi-Fi: `http://<laptop-ip>:3456/phone`.
Find the laptop's IP with `ipconfig` (Wireless LAN → IPv4).

**Trust model:** every request from the network must carry the PIN —
including the roster fetch — and wrong PINs are rate-limited. But the
PIN rides plain HTTP, so it stops a bystander reading the roster, not
someone who can already sniff the network. Use the church's private
Wi-Fi, not an open guest network. The Pusher secret and the PIN itself
are never readable over the network, even with a valid PIN.

For a roster kid the phone page never prints directly; it queues the
check-in for the main laptop, which does the real TwoTimTwo check-in and
prints through the normal (deduplicated) path. Its **Tonight** tab shows
exactly who this server is counting (the same list the lobby screens
total), with **Remove** (local only — it does not undo the check-in on
TwoTimTwo) and **Add back**. Two things do print straight from the
phone, because neither can double-print: a **visitor label** for someone
not on the roster, and a **Leader tag** for an adult volunteer (never
counted as a check-in).

Every leader whose tag has printed is remembered on this server
(`leaders.json` in the data folder — names only, no contact details) and
offered back as a one-tap chip on the phone page, the dashboard and the
check-in widget, so nobody types the same volunteer's name twice. Tick
several and **Print selected** tags a whole team. The **×** on a chip
forgets that leader; anyone not printed for a season hides itself
without being forgotten. Every club dropdown on all three surfaces is
served by the server (`GET /clubs`), so a club can never be missing from
one of them — which is exactly how the widget's walk-in dropdown ended
up as the only one without Journey.

See [SECURITY.md](../SECURITY.md) for the full trust model, what it
deliberately does not defend against, and the fork checklist.

## 5. Church configuration

`print-server/church-config.json` — check-in URL, club-night windows
(when live broadcasts run), shares club ids, Pusher channel. Baked
KVBC defaults apply if the file is missing. Forks change this one file.

## Per-night knobs (widget)

Step Up Night and Awana Store night modes: auto (from the TwoTimTwo
calendar), or forced on/off. Quick Mode makes any roster click a
one-tap check-in.
